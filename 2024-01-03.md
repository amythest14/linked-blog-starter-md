types of long term memory:

semantic: facts
procedural: actions and skills
episodic: events 

procedural memory refers to the memories that allow you to perform actions, such as playing the piano, whereas episodic memory would refer to a memory of you in the past playing the piano. these types of memory are separate so often retrograde amnesia affects procedural memory whereas the episodic memory remains intact.
