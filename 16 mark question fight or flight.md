The fight or flight response is a response that the body has when it is experiencing acute stress. The amygdala sends a signal to the hypothalamus, which then itself sends a signal to the adrenal gland. This gland then secretes adrenaline into the blood through the sympathetic nervous system, which causes the physiological changes experienced during the fight or flight response. The response happens due to that when humans evolved this response, the things that they would have to do in response to a stress or threat, were to either fight it or run away. For this reason when these situations occur the body insures that this can be done as well as possible by causing changes in the body to prepare. This include raised heart rate, and shutting down unnecessary processes to have more energy for other things such as digestion. In this example this would be the loss of salivation.
In this example, the car slamming on its brakes is acting as the acute stress. After a few minutes the parasympathetic nervous system sends a signal to cause a 'rest and digest' response in the body, making it return to its normal state.

A limitation of the fight and flight response is that research done on it was only into male participants. This androcentric research means that the findings cannot be generalised to women. Later research indicated that women show a different response, 'tend and befriend' and response to acute stress. For this reason fight and flight does not serve as a complete model for response to acute stress.

The fight or flight response was a necessary survival mechanism for out ancestors, however in the modern age it is rare that we experience these same situations that require such an intense response. Stresses in everyday life like worrying about exams can trigger this response when it serves no useful purpose, and can instead cause negative health impacts as it can lead to increased blood pressure and other symptoms. This suggests that the fight or flight response is not an appropriate response to stress in the modern day.

Other research into fight or flight has suggested an additional step, known as 'freeze' where people freeze in response to stress before either fighting or running away in an effort to avoid any confrontation to minimise the risk to them. In this freeze state people will be hyper-aware and thinking strongly about what they should do next. Because of this extra step that is excluded from the traditional model of the fight and flight response, this implies that the fight or flight model is incomplete and doesn't fully account for how people response to stresses.
