Fetch Execute Cycle

Components

CIR - current instruction register - stores the address of the instruction being currently executed
MBR - memory buffer register - holds the stuff that has been read from memory 
PC - program counter - holds the address of the next instruction 
MAR - memory address register - stores the memory location where data in the MBR is about to be written to or read from

The contents of the program counter is copies to the mar
goes through the address bus, and the contents at the address is returned through the data bus to the cir. the pc is incremented
copied from cir to mbr. 
the processor decodes the instructions and they are carried out, this might involve fetching more data from memory. the result is then stored in the accumalator of a general purpose register




a barcode reader works by passing a laser over the barcode. a photosensor then records the amount of light reflected from the center. Since white reflects better than black, this allows the barcode reader to differentiate between the black and white parts of the reader. The waveform produced by tyhe different amounts of current which correspond to black and white parts of the barcode can be converted into binary using an adc. These sequence of the two colors, which represents the bar code, is stored in binary - and can then be checked against a database of barcodes in the system such that the item can be added to a checkout till for example - or however else the barcode is being used. barcodes usually use a format in which lines of different widths correspond to different numbers such that the raw binary data can be converted into a code that is used to identify an item. One number in the bar code is used as a check digit, which allows the integriry of the barcode to be confirmed using a checking algorithm. If the checksum does not equal the check digit then the barcode scanner can return an error message.

qr codes are a type of barcode that encodes the data in two axis rather than one - and is often read by a camera typically in a smartphone rather than a specialised barcode scanner.
