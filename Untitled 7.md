Thank you for your message. I appreciate you writing. And I hear everything you say. You are right about everything (esp the emotional charge! ).There are always two ways of experiencing a situation and this is yours and I absolutely take it on board. (Though I did tell you about my note when I left this morning btw.) My experience is as follows: I think I am confused as to why you wouldn’t want me to help you by looking at your CV and I translate this into you not wanting to get a job. Perhaps not very logical to you but that is the way my brain seems to work. I am also frustrated because you aren’t eating enough and that is very triggering for me as I love you so much and don’t want you to fall headlong back into a difficult place if you are not careful. You spend much of your time in bed/in your room even when I am here to support you in your endeavours - and it is a slippery road. I would love to see you getting out into the fresh air every day to ensure positive mental health. These are the things that upset me. It isn’t fair of me to be upset with you when you are ill. I agree. And I absolutely appreciate you looking after the dogs while I was away. - though that was never my intention. It was only because you were stuck here anyway? And I thought they would be company for you so you. Would not be entirely alone? And it was your idea. In my memory??? I checked it with you 100 times before I left. It was a very bad idea in hindsight  - though did the dogs have anything to do with you hiding yourself away here, not doing anything? I wanted you to understand that you needed to get out and live your life and not rely on me for everything. I had given you a 2 year warning about me taking this trip.I didn’t expect you to come off your medication/lose weight so dramatically and   I always intended to give you the money I saved - but it is difficult to do that when I am upset with you because you are not looking after yourself properly and if giving you that money will give you less reason to find a job. The job is about going out, meeting people, being sociable. Living life. Not about the job.  I think you know that. This is a year of your life and we don’t know how many we get and I very badly want you to be able to live your best life. Getting a job is a way of collecting data so that you can work it out and do that. I hope when you have found your voice again and have eaten a few square meals that we can have a chat about all  of the above and find a way (job or no job) for you to have a good year this year and I hope you will let me help you to achieve that. You are a wonderful young man and I love having you at home - I just want you to have a good life. For god’s sake take some paracetamol. Shall I bring you a bowl of chicken noodle soup?


I appreciate you responding receptively. I don't think me looking after the dogs was my idea, but I don't think that matters too much. I think it was a relatively fine thing for me to look after the dogs. It inevitably made me feel a bit lonely and down at times - it'd be strange if it didn't - but I don't think it had any actual impact on my long-term mental health (and didn't have any effect on my eating (I haven't lost weight)). And I was very much happy to do it! But that doesn't make it any less of a big thing that I feel required appreciation and thanks which I feel you definitely did not show when you came home. I'm sorry I'm not eating much at the moment, but I'm just ill. I'm eating completely fine generally and hopefully I'll be back to that in a day or two. I do want to be getting a job and doing more and living life to the fullest but that is easier said than done. As for why I'm not desperate for you to look at my CV - it's because its embarrassing and scary. I think we should talk more when I'm feeling better and have a bit more brain power.
