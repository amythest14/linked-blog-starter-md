The behaviourist approach is an approach to psychology that attempts to explain how behaviour is learned. 

emerged at the beginning of the 20th century and became the dominant approach for half of that century.

The behaviourist approach only studies behaviour that can be observed and measured. It does not investigate internal processes of the mind. They tried to maintain objectivity in their research and thus relied on lab experiments to achieve this. 

Behaviourists thought that the same processes govern learning in all species, so animals were used in their experiments.

There were two forms of learning put forward by behaviourists:

[[Classical Conditioning]] - Pavlov's research
[[Operant Conditioning]] - Skinner's Research

| P   | The principles of conditioning have been applied to a many real-world problems. For instance, operant conditioning is the basis of token economy systems that are used in schools, prisons, and hospitals. These condition people by rewarding appropriate behaviour with tokens that can be exchanged for privileges. Classical conditioning has been applied to the [[Treatment of Phobia]]. |
