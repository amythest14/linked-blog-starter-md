Ivan Pavlov discovered that his dogs salivated to the sound of footsteps, because originally the sound of footsteps immediately preceded being fed. This is called classical conditioning - learning through association.

He went on to do many experiments with his dogs, showing that the dogs could be conditioned to salivate to the sound of a bell if that sound was repeatedly presented at the same time they were given the food. They would then produce the salivation response every time they heard the sound. 

1. Before conditioning

Food (unconditioned response) ----> Salivation (unconditioned response)

2. During conditioning

Bell (neutral stimulus) + Food (unconditioned stimulus) ----> Salivation (unconditioned response)

3. After conditioning

Bell (conditioned response) ----> Salivation (conditioned response)
