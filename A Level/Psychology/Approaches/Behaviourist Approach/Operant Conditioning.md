**BF Skinner (1953)** suggested that learning is an active process where behaviour is either reinforced or punished, leading to behaviour being learned.

During operant conditioning behaviour leads to three consequences:

* **Positive reinforcement** - receiving a reward when a certain behaviour is performed. This **increases** the likelihood that behaviour will be repeated.

* **Negative reinforcement** - avoidance of something unpleasant. This also **increases** the likelihood that behaviour will be repeated. An example is student handing in an essay in order to not get told off.

* **Punishment** - an unpleasant consequence of behaviour. This **decreases** the likelihood of behaviour being repeated

Skinner conducted experiments with rats in specially designed cages called skinner boxes. Every time the rat activated a lever within the box it was rewarded with a food pellet. The animal would then continue to perform the behaviour. 

He also showed how the rats could be conditioned to avoid an unpleasant stimulus, such as an electric shock.

Skinner discovered that if an animal was rewarded every time it activated the lever or pecked the disc, the conditioned behaviour become extinct as the animal was satiated (full of food pellets).

He found that a **variable ratio schedule** would prolong the behaviour and was most resistant to extinction. Here, reinforcement is given after a variable number of lever pushes. This concept has been applied to many forms of human behaviour, namely gambling addiction.
