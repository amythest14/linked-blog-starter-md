This is a development of the [[Behaviourist Approach]], proposed by **Albert Bandura**. He proposed a different way in which people learn: through observation and imitation of others. 

 
## Vicarious reinforcement

Indirect learning takes please when an individual observes the behaviour of others. The learner may imitate this behaviour but generally imitation only occurs if the behaviour is seen to be rewarded rather than punished. This is called **vicarious reinforcement**. 

## The role of mediational processes

SLT can be described as the bridge between traditional learning theory and the [[Cognitive Approach]] because it focuses on how cognitive factors are involved in learning. These factors mediate in the learning process to determine whether a new response is required. Bandura identified four mediational processes:

1. Attention - the extent to which we notice certain behaviours.
2. Retention - how well the behaviour is remembered.
3. Motor reproduction - the ability of the observer to perform the behaviour.
4. Motivation - the will to perform the behaviour, often determined by the consequences of the observed behaviour.

## Identification

People (especially children) are more likely to imitate behaviour of people that they identify with, called role models. A person becomes a role model if they have similar characteristics to the observer and/or are attractive and have high status. They may not be physically present in the environment, which has implications for the influence of media on behaviour, as shown in one of Bandura's [[Bobo Doll Study| Bobo doll studies]].
