Bandura *et at* (1961) recorded the behaviour of young children who watched an adult behave aggressively towards a Bobo doll, such as punching and shouting at the doll. These children played with the doll much more aggressively compared to the control group, who watched the adult play nicely with the doll.

Bandura and Walters (1963) showed videos to children where again an adult behaved aggressively towards the Bobo doll. Group 1 saw the adult praised for their behaviour, group 2 showed the adult scolded, group 3 saw the aggression with no consequence. When presented with their own Bobo doll, group 1 showed the most aggression followed by group 3, and then group 2.

This experiment has implications for the media, as children and adults may be influenced by the violence they see in movies and video games. A practical implication of this research was the implementation of age ratings for movies.
