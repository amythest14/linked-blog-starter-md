Natural selection - human behaviour is driven by the need to survive and reproduce. Males and females need to make sure that they have children and those children survive into childhood. Genes that give a reproductive advantage will increase in the gene pool.

Inter-sexual selection - females, due to the high investment and parental certainty, pick the highest quality mate from a wide selection of available mates according to attractive features indicating good genes

Intra-sexual selection - males, due to low investment costs and lack of parental certainty, competing between each other for access to a large quantity of members of the other sex. This favours dominant large males.

Male-Female dimorphism - enhanced secondary sexual characteristics are selected for by both genders, leading to these becoming more common in the population.

Females look for qualities that will help raise a child to adulthood: resources/money, tall/healthy (and generally characteristics that suggest dominance), V shaped chest.

Males look for qualities of fertility that indicate production of healthy offspring: large breasts, young facial features, body shape of 0.7 waist to hip ratio - indicates sexual maturity but not pregnant

Anisogamy - differences between the male and female gametes


Study - Buss

Across 33 countries, Buss surveyed 10,000 adults on partner preferences when selecting a mate. He found males prioritised factors that indicated reproductive capacity such as younger age, chastity and good looks. Females prioritised factors that indicate resources such as money, ambition and industriousness.
He conducted his research across multiple countries so it can be argued that this research is free from[[Gender & Culture Bias | culture bias]] and reflects emic constructs.


Study - Dunbar and Waynforth

Used content analysis method of 900 personal dating ads across four USA newspapers. Found 42% males looked for youthful mates compared to 25% of females. Men were more likely to emphasise their economic status in their own adverts, women were more likely to emphasise their looks.

Study - Clarke and Heartfield

Male and female student researchers asked other students on campus one of three questions. "will you go out with me tonight?", "will you go back to my house", or "will you have sex with me". 50% of both genders agreed to a date that night, whilst 0% of females agreed to sex compared to 75% of males.
Suggests that women are more selective with sexual partners, whilst males want to mate with as many people as possible.


Evaluation

There is a conflict between natural selection and sexual selection, as some adaptations that are sexual selected for result in disadvantages for survival. An example of this is the large peacock feathers that males use to attract a mate.

The evolutionary approach could be criticised as legitimising double standards between genders. Sexual difference may have been exaggerated, suggesting Alpha bias. 

Research in this area could be seen as socially sensitive. Findings could be used as a justification for shaming women for their sexual behaviour

These evolutionary explanations for sexual selection can also be criticised for not explaining homosexual relationships.
