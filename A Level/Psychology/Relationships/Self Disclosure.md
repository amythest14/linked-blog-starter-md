Self disclosure is a factor affecting attraction. Attraction is the action or power of evoking interest in or liking for someone.

We tend to disclose more information to those we like, and like people who reveal information about themselves to us. This is thought to be an indication of trust that information will stay between the individuals.

Altman & Taylor suggest that as the relationship between individuals develops as the *breadth* and *depth* of interpersonal communication increases from shallow levels to become more intimate. They call this social penetration theory (SPT). 

Breadth is the types of topics that can be discussed with a partner, whereas depth is the level of information about a topic that they reveal partner. This could be information this is emotionally painful.

Reciprocity - Relationships will only develop if both individuals are active in both disclosing and responding in an appropriate way.

Attribution - individuals consider the motivations behind self disclosure, someone who is seen to disclose to anyone, is seen as less attractive than someone who discloses to us because they see us as special.
