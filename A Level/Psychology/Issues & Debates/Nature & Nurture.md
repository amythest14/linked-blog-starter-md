The nature nurture debate is to what extent is behaviour determined due to hereditary 'nature' factors like genes or environmental 'nurture' factors.


Nativists such as Descartes assume biological factors are more important in determined behaviour, knowledge is innate. There is evidence for genes affecting disorders such as [[Schizophrenia]].

Nurture - Empiricists assume learning is more important in determining behaviour; knowledge is coming from the environment. The mind starts as a blank state.

Bandura's Bobo doll study provides evidence for social learning theory.

Determinism - both nature and nurture are deterministic but they differ in what factors control behaviour.

Twin studies show evidence for nurture as MZ often show higher concordance rates for behaviour than DZ twins.

Most psychologists take an interactionist approach, viewing nature and nurture as working together.
