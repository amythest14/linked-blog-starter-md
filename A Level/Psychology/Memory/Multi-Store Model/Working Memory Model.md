Baddeley and Hitch developed their own theory about how STM works. Rather than just storing information, working memory is an active processor that manipulates nd analyses the information. They believe that short term memory is divided into several components, each with different coding and capacity.

#### Visuo-spatial Sketchpad

The visuo-spatial sketchpad is used when you have plan a spatial task It involves holding visual and spatial information and can be thought of as the inntere eye. The VSS contains a visual cache which stores information about form and colour, and a visual scribe that rehearses information in the visual cache and transfers it to the central executive. The visuospatial sketchpad also has a limited capacity and limited duration as a temporary store. Information is coded visually.

#### Central Executive

This is an important part of the model which directs attention to particular tasks and decides whether to send data to the phonological or visual part the STM to be stored or manipulated. It has a very limited capacity so it can only attend to a limited number things at any time. IT also deals with cognitive tasks such as mental arithmetic and problem solving. It can processs information from any sensory modality.

#### Phonological Loop
