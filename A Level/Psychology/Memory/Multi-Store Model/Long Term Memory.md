The LTM is a 'permanent' store that holds unlimited amounts of information for long periods of time. LTM can be split up into **declarative** (explicit) memories, and **procedural** (implicit). 

Declarative can itself be split into **semantic** memory and **episodic** memory.

#### Episodic Memory

This is the memory of autobiographical events - your own life. This includes times, places, emotions felt, and more. It is the collection of *past personal experiences* that occurred at a particular time. They are time stamped meaning that you know when the memory was made, and declarative meaning they are able to be consciously recalled. These memories are stored in the **hippocampus**.

#### Semantic Memory

This is the memory of meanings, understandings and concepts. Semantic memory underlies the conscious recollection of *factual information* and general knowledge about the world. For example, knowing what the capital of Burkina Faso is (Ouagadougou). These are not time stamped, but are declarative. These memories are stored in the **temporal lobe**.

#### Procedural Memory

The memory for the performance of particular types of *actions and skills*. This resides below the level of conscious awareness. When needed, they are automatically retrieved and utilised for the execution of the procedures involved in the cognitive and motor skills - from playing guitar to reading. These are not time stamped and are implicit. These memories are **amnesia resistant**. These memories are stored in the **cerebellum & motor cortex**.


# Evaluation

Brain scans provide support for LTM, showing the different areas of the brain are active for different types of recall. For example, semantic memories are stored in the temporal lobe whereas procedural memories are stored in the cerebellum.

Research has low population validity. A lot of research into long-term memory has been case studies. For example, Clive Wearing had brain damage that allowed psychologists to gain further insight into long-term memory. But these findings are difficult to generalise to the whole population, due to them relying on one person (who had brain damage). 

Understanding types of memory allows for real-world applications. Studies found that the episodic memory performance of older people suffering with a mild cognitive impairment who received memory training with that of a control group.

Research into LTM has used both idiographic and research. Evidence for the separation of LTM stores using brain imaging has been backed up with the idiographic case studies from individuals who have experienced brain damage.
