The multi-store model describes how information flows through different stores of the memory system.

The model, proposed by **Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968)**, sees memory as a linear transfer of information through three separate stores.

These are:
[[Sensory Register]]
[[Short Term Memory]]
[[Long Term Memory]]

|                   | Duration  | Capacity  | Coding            |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| Sensory Register  | 250ms     | Unlimited | Modality Specific |
| Short-Term Memory | 30s       | 5-7       | Acoustic          |
| Long-Term Memory  | Unlimited | Unlimited | Semantic                  |
