## recall

types of experiment:

quasi - IV is not truly manipulated, as it already exists like that (ie. gender) but otherwise in a control 
pros: similarly to lab experiment, controlled environment increases reliability
cons: such an artificial setting reduces validity


field - experiment that takes place in the real world, but researcher still controls the IV

lab - researcher controls IV and experiment takes place in controlled environment

natural - naturally occurring event is observed and studied by researcher. they are not manipulating the IV.
