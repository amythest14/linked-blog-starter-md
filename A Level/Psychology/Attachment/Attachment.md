An attachment is a two way emotional tie to another person

 reciprocity involves responding to an action with a corresponding action, whereas interactional synchrony is where each person does the same action at the same time.

an example of reciprocity would be the parent smiling at the baby and the baby smiling back, whereas synchrony would be the baby and parent smiling at each other at the same time.
