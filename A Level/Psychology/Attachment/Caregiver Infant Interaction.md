[[Attachment]] is an enduring two-way emotional bond between two people. 

Reciprocity is a two way mutual process in which an individual takes turns. Both infant and mother respond to each others signals and each elicits a response from the other.

Interactional synchrony is where the mother and infant reflect both the actions and emotions of the other and do this in a co-ordinated way at the same time.

Meltzoff and Moore examined caregiving interactions by observing the responses to an adults facial expressions. There was a clear association between the infants behaviour and the adults suggesting that interactional synchrony is innate and reduces the strength of any claim that imitative behaviour is learned. 

However, Piaget believed the infants repeated the behaviours because they were being rewarded, what he called pseudo-imitation.
