## [[Caregiver Infant Interaction]]

Interactional synchrony 
Reciprocity
Multzoff and Moore 
Challenge - Piaget suggested a behaviourist reason for synchrony, that they were rewarded for their actions

## [[Stages of attachment]]

Research by Schaffer on Glasgow babies came up with these stages of attachment.

Asocial pre-attachment stage: 0-6 weeks
Indiscriminate attachment: 6 weeks - 6 months
Discriminate attachment: 7 - 9 months
Multiple attachments: Over 9 months 

## Role of the father

Father as playmate
Father as secondary attachment figure
Father as primary attachment figure (when mother is absent) - they are just as capable and child grows up the same which shows that mothers are not biologically pre-determined to be the primary caregiver and it is more societal.

## [[Animal studies of attachment]]

Harlow: Wire monkey with milk, cloth monkey without milk. The baby monkey much preferred the cloth monkey, which goes against the previous theory of learning theory.

Lorenz: Did research into the attachments of geese. He found that they imprinted themselves into the first moving object they saw.
