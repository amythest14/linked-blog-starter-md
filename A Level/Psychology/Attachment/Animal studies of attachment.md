Lorenz researched[[Attachment | attachment]] in animals, specifically geese. He found that the geese imprinted themselves onto the first moving object they saw after they hatched. When they saw him first, they followed him as if he was their mother. Later in life they performed mating rituals to him, and ignored other geese. This suggests that they were operating within a critical period which was underpinned by biological changes. 

Harlow conducted research into rhesus monkeys. Harlow created two fake monkey mothers, one of which was made of wire and the other was wrapped in a soft cloth. The wire monkey was the one that provided food. Contrary to previous theories that said that the reason for attachment was food, the monkeys spent the majority of their time with the cloth monkey, indicating comfort is as important for attachment as food. Later in life these monkeys were sexually abnormal, and did not cradle their babies. This emphasises the impact of neglect to babies.
