The limbic system is a system in [[The Brain]].

Made up from:

- Hypothalamus (regulates the autonomic nervous system, part of the [[Fight or Flight Response]]
- Amygdala (starts the [[Fight or Flight Response]] and is responsible for emotions)
- Hippocampus (responsible for [[Long Term Memory]]). 

Raine found that killers had:

less activity in the prefrontal cortex -> less impulse control
abnormality in amygdala function -> overreactions, flight or flight is more easily triggered
abnormality in hippocampus -> hard to learn from mistakes
less activity in the corpus callosum -> harder for the brains hemispheres to communicate


There are many structures within the limbic system that affect aggression. The amygdala is the part of the limbic system that affects the perception of emotion. It also it what starts the fight or flight response, so abnormalities in amygdala function could overreact causing the flight or flight response, in the case of aggression namely the 'fight' part, in situations where it does not warrant it.

There is research to support this idea. Raine found that killers had abnormalities in amygdala function compared to a control group, suggesting that there is a difference in the brains of people who commit aggressive acts. There have also been case studies to support this, with mass shooter Charles Whitman having a tumour pressing on his amygdala, suggesting that this could have been what caused him to act so aggressively. This suggests that abnormalities within the limbic system present a neural explanation for aggression.

However, brain plasticity puts the correlational nature of this research into question. Plasticity is the idea that the brain and structures in the brain can change in response to the environment, especially experience or trauma. This could challenge the neural explanation of aggression because the neural correlates that affect aggression could simply be the result of a plastic brain adapting to increased level of aggression. This would suggest that changes in the limbic system are just the result of aggressive behaviour, rather than the other way round.

A debate relevant to the role of the limbic system in aggression is that of determinism. If aggressive actions are the result of physical differences within the brain such as brain tumors, then the actions of people who commit violent crimes could be seen as deterministic, as their brain structures that affected their aggression were out of their control. This has implications in law and the sentencing of criminals who commit aggressive acts, as if they have deficits within the limbic system then they could be seen to not be responsible for their actions.



Males demonstrate higher levels of aggression than females

testosterone activates the limbic system and reduces activity of the prefrontal cortex - this is resduces by the effects of serotonin and cortisol.
