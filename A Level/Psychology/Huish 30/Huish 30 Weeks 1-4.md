#### WEEK 1: WUNDT & THE BEHAVIOURIST APPROACH

###### Q1: Outline Wundt’s method of introspection.

Wundt's method of introspection involved the examination of one's own conscious thoughts and emotions in response to a stimulus. To perform introspection, you had to be specially trained. He aimed to break conscious experiences down into their most basic elements.

###### Q2: Millie is asked to do a class presentation on introspection. As part of her presentation she said, "Introspection is thinking about our own thoughts." Explain what else Millie could have said about the major features of introspection so that classmates would be better informed.

She could have mentioned how introspection involved breaking down our complex mental processes into basic senses, allowing for better analysis of the mind. It is not just thinking about ones owns thoughts but also actively examining emotions and sensations. Introspection needed lots of training and practice in order to do it effectively. This helps to allow the participants report their thoughts without bias.

###### Q3: Describe Wundt's role in the development of psychology.

Wundt had a pioneering role in the development of psychology, opening the first psychology laboratory. This signified how Wundt changed psychology from a branch of philosophy to the beginnings of an empirical science. He founded an approach to psychology known as structuralism which broke down consciousness into its most basic elements via technique called introspection. Whilst introspection is unfalsifiable as it relies on individuals observing their own thoughts, leading to subjectivity. This means that is has both low validity and reliability, leading to other approaches becoming prominent in psychology. However the reductionist view that Wundt pioneered with structuralism would continue with the behaviourist and cognitive and approaches to psychology, meaning that Wundt had a fundamental role in the development of psychology.

###### Q4: Briefly outline how Pavlov investigated [[Classical Conditioning]].

Pavlov investigated classical conditioning by conducting experiments with dogs. He paired a neutral stimulus (for example a bell though when he first discovered classical conditioning it was the sound of footsteps) with the unconditioned stimulus of food. This caused the dogs to associate the bell with the food and would salivate from the sound of the bell alone even when no food was present. The bell becomes a conditioned stimulus and the salivation is a conditioned response.

###### Q5: A young woman says: “When I was 5 years old, I was at a party and a balloon burst with a loud bang in my face. Even after all these years, I cannot bear to go into a room where there are balloons. They terrify me!” Use your knowledge of classical conditioning to explain why the young woman is terrified of balloons.

Initially the balloon was a neutral stimulus but when paired with the unconditioned stimulus of the loud noise, which creates the response of being scared, she associated balloons with the loud noise. The balloons became a conditioned stimulus with the fear being a conditioned response.

###### Q6: Explain how reinforcement might be used to encourage primary school children to pick up litter in the playground.

The principles of operant conditioning could encourage them to pick up litter. A positive reinforcement system could be used where the children are given a reward like tokens that can be exchanged for sweets when they pick up litter. This reward reinforces the behaviour so they will continue to pick up the litter.

###### Q7: Lily and Jemima have a pet rat, which usually hides in a corner when they try to take it out of its cage. They have tried different ways to stop the rat hiding, but so far without success. Use your knowledge of **two** types of reinforcement to suggest how Lily and Jemima could train their rat to come to the cage door when they open it.

One type of reinforcement they could use is positive reinforcement. This is a type of reinforcement that Skinner used in his model of operant conditioning. It involves presenting a positive stimulus in response to the desired behaviour, encouraging this behaviour to continue as the subject has hopes of more reward. In Lily and Jemima's case this would involve rewarding the rat with food when the rat doesn't go into the corner. This way, the rat is conditioned to continue not going into the corner as this will get it presented with food. Another type of reinforcement they could use is negative reinforcement. Skinner defined negative reinforcement in his model of operant conditioning to be when behaviour is strengthened by removing an unpleasant stimulus. In this example this would involve removing something unpleasant from the rat when he comes out for the corner. For example playing a loud and unpleasant noise whenever the rat is out of the cage, which only gets turned down if the rat stays out of the corner.

###### Q8: Outline Skinner's research into reinforcement.

Skinner performed research into reinforcement by placing an animal such as a rat in a chamber known as a 'Skinner Box'. In some experiments food pellets would be dispensed when the rat performed a certain action such as pressing a button, so Skinner could measure whether behaviour was encouraged and thus repeated by the introduction of a positive stimulus. This was the basis of positive conditioning. Other versions had the rats getting electric shocks that were turned off when they did an action, investigating negative reinforcement.

#### WEEK 2: SLT & THE COGNITIVE APPROACH

###### Q1: Mr Benson is a primary school teacher. He has noticed that some of the children in his class push to the front of the queue when it is time to leave the classroom. Suggest how Mr Benson might use vicarious reinforcement to alter the behaviour of these children. Explain your answer with reference to social learning theory.

Social learning theory says that watching a role model getting praised results in vicarious reinforcement and behaviour will be encouraged in the person watching. So Mr Benson could praise some of the children that do not push, and even reward them by giving them sweets or 'praise points'. This might work even better if he praised the more popular children in the class when they don't push as they would be seen as more of a role model to the other children.

###### Q2: Grace’s room is always messy. Her older sister, Lily, keeps her room very tidy. The next time Lily tidies her room, the girls’ mother gives Lily five pounds. Using your knowledge of social learning theory, explain why Grace might be more likely to tidy her room in the future.

In social learning theory, people are described to imitate the actions of those they observe being rewarded, called vicarious reinforcement.
