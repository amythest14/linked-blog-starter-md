#### WEEK 1: WUNDT & THE BEHAVIOURIST APPROACH

###### Q1: Outline Wundt’s method of introspection.

Wundt's method of introspection involved the examination of one's own conscious thoughts and emotions in response to a stimulus. To perform introspection, you had to be specially trained. He aimed to break conscious experiences down into their most basic elements.

###### Q2: Millie is asked to do a class presentation on introspection. As part of her presentation she said, "Introspection is thinking about our own thoughts." Explain what else Millie could have said about the major features of introspection so that classmates would be better informed.

She could have mentioned how introspection involved breaking down our complex mental processes into basic senses, allowing for better analysis of the mind. It is not just thinking about ones owns thoughts but also actively examining emotions and sensations. Introspection needed lots of training and practice in order to do it effectively. This helps to allow the participants report their thoughts without bias.

###### Q3: Describe Wundt's role in the development of psychology.

Wundt had a pioneering role in the development of psychology, opening the first psychology laboratory. This signified how Wundt changed psychology from a branch of philosophy to the beginnings of an empirical science. He founded an approach to psychology known as structuralism which broke down consciousness into its most basic elements via technique called introspection. Whilst introspection is unfalsifiable as it relies on individuals observing their own thoughts, leading to subjectivity. This means that is has both low validity and reliability, leading to other approaches becoming prominent in psychology. However the reductionist view that Wundt pioneered with structuralism would continue with the behaviourist and cognitive and approaches to psychology, meaning that Wundt had a fundamental role in the development of psychology.

###### Q4: Briefly outline how Pavlov investigated [[Classical Conditioning]].

Pavlov investigated classical conditioning by conducting experiments with dogs. He paired a neutral stimulus (for example a bell though when he first discovered classical conditioning it was the sound of footsteps) with the unconditioned stimulus of food. This caused the dogs to associate the bell with the food and would salivate from the sound of the bell alone even when no food was present. The bell becomes a conditioned stimulus and the salivation is a conditioned response.

###### Q5: A young woman says: “When I was 5 years old, I was at a party and a balloon burst with a loud bang in my face. Even after all these years, I cannot bear to go into a room where there are balloons. They terrify me!” Use your knowledge of classical conditioning to explain why the young woman is terrified of balloons.

Initially the balloon was a neutral stimulus but when paired with the unconditioned stimulus of the loud noise, which creates the response of being scared, she associated balloons with the loud noise. The balloons became a conditioned stimulus with the fear being a conditioned response.

###### Q6: Explain how reinforcement might be used to encourage primary school children to pick up litter in the playground.

The principles of operant conditioning could encourage them to pick up litter. A positive reinforcement system could be used where the children are given a reward like tokens that can be exchanged for sweets when they pick up litter. This reward reinforces the behaviour so they will continue to pick up the litter.
