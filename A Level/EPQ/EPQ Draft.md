Tonal music comprises almost all music ever composed, performed, or produced. All of this music relies on systems and hierarchies that form the basis of the music theory that has driven composition for millennia. Notes form scales, from which we derive keys, from which we derive chords. Systems govern all music, even if the performer isn’t conscious of them. Tuning systems define the pitches that can be used in music. The exact pitches or relationships between pitches can vary wildly between tuning systems, so what is considered ‘in tune’ in one system may be ‘out of tune’ in another. The system that has been almost exclusively used since the 18th century contains 12 notes to the octave, however this number is not set in stone. Microtonal tuning systems have more than 12 notes, so have a base interval smaller than the semitones 100 cents. Tuning systems traditionally used in non-western music can have from as little as 7 notes per octave, to as many as 53. However the decisions around where these pitches go are not at all arbitrary. When two notes are played at once, humans have an intuitive sense of what sounds consonant and dissonant. Whilst tuning systems with more notes may have dissonant intervals that allow for interesting complex harmony, they need consonant intervals to maintain a tonal sound. The consonance of intervals are driven by the mathematical principles of sound, which form a basis for theoretically perfectly consonant intervals. It is mathematically impossible to have every interval be perfectly in tune with each other at once however, so forming tuning systems becomes about compromise. The consonance of some intervals comes at the cost of others, which creates a balancing act that has resulted in many different tuning systems being in contention for ‘the best’. This is the topic I will attempt to tackle in this report: What is the best tuning system?

What our ears perceive as sound is physically the vibration of air particles, which create oscillating waves of pressure that move towards the ear. The most simple wave is the sine wave, with the pressure of the sound varying over time in a smooth pattern that takes the shape of a sine curve, when graphed as a function of pressure over time. The amplitude of the curve represents the loudness of the sound, while the frequency of these peaks represents the perceived pitch of the sound. All other sounds are made up from complex waves, which have a graph with a different shape. Mathematician Joseph Fourier showed that any function can be represented as the sums of simpler trigonometric functions, sine and cosine. Since sound can be represented as a function of pressure over time, the waveforms of these complex tones can be shown through Fourier analysis to be made up from a number of constituent sine waves. For this reason sine waves are known as ‘pure tones’ as they only have one frequency whereas complex waves have many. These other waves, known as harmonics, occur with frequencies at integer multiples of the fundamental - collectively known as the harmonic series. 

The harmonic series is the basis of all the intervals used in music. The octave is equivalent to the frequency ratio between the fundamental and the second harmonic (2:1), the perfect fifth is derived from the ratio between the second and third harmonic (3:2), the major third is derived from the ratio between the fourth and fifth harmonic (5:4) and so on. Generally, the more simple the frequency ratio, the more consonant the interval is to the listener. When intervals are tuned to these pure frequency ratios this is known as “just intonation”. JI is a system in which all of the intervals can be represented by whole number ratios, like the 3:2 ratio of a perfect fifth. This way all intervals are completely pure. However, technically any interval in any tuning system can be represented as whole number ratios. For example the 12TET major third has a whole number ratio - of 15749:12500. Viewing JI like this results in an unusable system for tuning as it would have an infinite number of intervals making it useless for the very purpose of tuning systems: defining intervals to form the basis of a system of harmony. For this reason, JI does not refer to any singular tuning system itself, but rather a number of systems that have had ‘limits’ to the complexity of the frequency ratios by theorists. The most common limiting system is the p-limit, in which ratios can only consist of integers with prime factors no larger than p. Using these just intervals results in a pure sound free from the beating present in impure intervals. Beating is a psychoacoustic phenomena in which the amplitude of the resultant sound modulates when two tones are played simultaneously, with one of them being slightly out of tune from the just interval of another. Intuitively and mathematically this makes sense, as the resulting waveform when playing two tones simultaneously is calculated simply by adding the amplitude of their waveforms together. Considering two sine waves, very nearly at unison - if one wave has a slightly different frequency than the other then due to the periodic nature of the sine function, then the difference between the two waves will increase as you go further across the $x$ axis. If $f(x)=\sin(x)$  and $g(x)=\sin(1.01x)$ then when $x=\frac{\pi}{2}$, $f(x)=1$ and $g(x)=1.01$. Each period
