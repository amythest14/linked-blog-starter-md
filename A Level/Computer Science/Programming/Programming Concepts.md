A program is a series of statements, which produce programming constructs

All statements written will fall into one of three programming constructs:

#### Sequence

Do one statement after the other in order.

#### Selection

Do a set of statements based on a condition, allowing your code to make choice - known as branching. This can be done using [[If Statement | If Statements]].

#### Iteration

Do a set of statements again and again, also known as looping.

All iterations are either:

Count controlled loops -  does the statements a fixed number of times

Condition controlled loop - does the statements until a condition is met



[[Subroutines]] are self-contained set of commands that can be called from different parts of a program.

These come in two main forms: Procedures and Functions

They are used for breaking down a problem into smaller manageable sections, and preventing duplicate sections of code when it is needed more than once to solve a problem.

Procedures take a number of parameters and carry out a set task.

Functions take a number of parameters, carries out a set task and returns a value.
