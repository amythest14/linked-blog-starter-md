A stack is an example of a last in first out structure that means that the last item of data added is the first to be removed

a stack in a computer works in exactly the same way as a stack of books waiting to be marked - the one added to the top last will be the first to be dealt with

adding a new item of data to the stack is called pushing

taking an item off the stack is called popping

stacks can be used to store single elements but more oftena  stack will contain a series of instructions and data

in this case it is known as a stack frame and a pointer will be used to identify the start point of the frame

this is used as a call stack when running programs as it can be used when a subroutine is running to call functions and pass parameters and arguments


stacks are used to store successive nested loops 

they are used in recursion where a subroutine calls itself

compare with [[Queues]]
