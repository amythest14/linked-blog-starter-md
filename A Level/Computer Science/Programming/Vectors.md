A vector is a series of numbers that represent information such as position, velocity or force.

They can be written in various notations

So for example you can specify the list of numbers

42, 110, -5.5, 10.75


as a list of numbers

[42, 100, -5.5, 10.75]

ar a dictionary

{0 : 42, 1 : 110, 2 : -5.5, 3 : 10.75}

Array[0..3] of real 
myVector[0] = 42
myVector[1] = 110
myVector[2] = -5.5
myVector[3] = 10.75


a vector can also be stored as a function where the domain is the set S={0,1,2,3} and the co-domain is the set of real numbers so 0 maps to 42, 1 maps to 110 etc

where there is x numbers in the vector it is called a x-vector so in this case a 4-vector (over weird R whatever that means)


the 2-vector can be represented as an arrow with its tail at the origin and its head at 5, 7

a 3-vector can be represented by an arrow in a 3d grid which provides the information needed to map a straight line from the origin to its destination.

you can add and subtract vectors

if you have the vector A = (2, 3) and B = (6, 5)

visualising this on a graph you move vector B to the end of vector A and then you find the vector of the straight line that goes between the origin and the new position of B

you do essentially the same thing with subtraction ykykyk im sure you can work that out


scalar vector multiplication

literally just multiply the numbers could not be more simple nglllll
