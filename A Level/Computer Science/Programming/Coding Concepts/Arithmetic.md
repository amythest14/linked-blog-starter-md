To add two numbers together:

```cs
int sum = 5 + 3
```

To subtract one number from another:

```cs
int diff = 5 - 3
```

To  multiply one number from another:

```cs
int product = 5 * 3
```

To divide one number by another: 

```cs
int quotient = 5 / 3
```

To calculate the remainder of a division operation:

```cs
int mod = 5 % 3
```

To increment or decrement a [[Variables|variable]] by one:

```cs
int number = 5
number++; //increments
number--; //decrements
```

Compound assignment operators:

Instead of doing  `variable = variable + 5`, you can instead do the following:

```cs
variable += 5
```

Similarly, you can do this with other compound assignment operators including `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `%=`.
