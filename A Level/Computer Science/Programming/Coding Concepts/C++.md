C++ is a [[Programming Language]] that evolved from [[C]]. First appearing in 1985, it extended the [[Procedural Programming]] of C by including functionality for the [[Object-Oriented Programming]] programming paradigm. It supports features such as [[Classes]], [[Inheritance]], [[Polymorphism]], templates, and exception handling, enabling developers to create modular, reusable, and extensible code. It is a very powerful language that allows for low-level control whilst maintaining high level abstractions. It has precise control over memory which allows programs written in C++ to be very efficient and run very quickly.
