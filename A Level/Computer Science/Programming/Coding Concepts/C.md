C is a versatile and widely used [[Programming Language]] that was developed in the early 1970s. Known for its efficiency, simplicity, and low-level control, C is often used for system programming, embedded systems, and developing high-performance applications. It provides low-level access to memory, allows direct manipulation of hardware, and offers a compact syntax. It uses the [[Procedural Programming]] paradigm.
