  
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain both data (attributes) and behaviour (methods). The principles of OOP provide guidelines for designing and organising code in an object-oriented manner. This is done using [[Classes]] and [[Objects]].

These principles are:

[[Encapsulation]] - 

[[Inheritance]] - 

[[Polymorphism]] - 

[[Abstraction]] - 

[[Association]] - 

[[Composition]] - 

[[Aggregation]] -
