C# is a [[Programming Language]] developed by [[Microsoft]]. It is primarily an [[Object-Oriented Programming|Object-Oriented]] language. It is built to work seamlessly with the [[.NET]] framework to develop applications on the Microsoft platform.

It is statically typed, meaning the [[Data Types]] of [[Variables]] are fixed and must be specified in code. It is in the [[C]] family but is a far higher level language than C or [[C++]]. 

As opposed to C and C++, C# uses a garbage collector to automatically manage memory allocation and deallocation. Programmers don't need to explicitly allocate or deallocate memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks and simplifying memory management.
