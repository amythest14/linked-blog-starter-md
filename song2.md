oh darling, 
may i touch your wings
and feel your skin
and kiss your flesh
your glow within
venerated, 
how i cherish our time
while i still can
and i must confess
you fly so high
above me
i must look tiny to you,
poor thing

venerated, 
chosen by you 
and i mustn't
let you down
how can i breath
in front of that of perfect breath

how can i laugh in the face of
how can i stop the
disillusion of perfect sex

so i'll fall apart 
like people fall apart
i'll burn all my money
and re-take up guitar



i need you here
and i need you now
i'll feel the fear
and i'll need you out

can't get you out my head
can't get you out my head
it's like you need me dead
need you to cut me open
and eat me out
i need you here
i need you now

and i like when i am in your mouth
soÂ  speak my name
and speak it loud


~~
~~i wish that i was the most beautiful girl you'd ever seen
but i think that that's unlikely
always too hot or too cold
never something in between
so look me in the eye
and tell me what i mean
i mean, to you
you are not here
a spectral projection
taunting me with what i can't have
are you my angel
offering me protection
or a succubus
here for my inevitable erection
~~
