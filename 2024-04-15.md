Division of the nervous system
Types of Neurones - motor, relay, sensory; reflex arc
Brain Localisation
Areas of Brain 
synaptic transmission
Brain lateralisation - brocas area, wernickes area
split-brain research
fight or flight
plasticity and functional recovery
endocrine system
biological rhythms - endogenous pacemakers and exogenous zeitgebers
menstrual cycle
sleep wake cycle
sleep stages cycles
Brain scanning methods - MRI, ERP, EEG, post mortem


endogenous pacemakers - internal factors
exogenous zeitgebers - external factors
circadian rhythms - 24 hours
sieffre - found that sleep wake cycle goes to about 25 hours when free running
internal body clock; internal factors that synchronise - SCN, melatonin
exogenous zeitgebers - light, meal times, social cues, 
entrainment - where ep and ez need to synchronise
the SCN is at the optic nerve so the production of melatonin is inhibited by light
infradian rhythms - longer than a day, menstrual cycle
has ep of estrogen and progesterone
potentially has ez of pheromones (synchronisation research), otherwise food etc can be an ez


ultradian rhythms - sleep cycle - less than a day
you go through the stages of sleep 1>2>3>2>1>REM and repeats around 4 nights through the night
deeper sleep leads to slower brain waves with higher amplitudes
may be linked to the sleep wake cycle

\3b. Because there are no distinct outliers, the mean is most appropriate as it takes into account all of the data without being distorted
\4. An example of an ultradian rhythm is the sleep cycle, which is the cycle of the stages of sleep. This goes from the lightest stage of sleep (stage 1) to a very deep sleep (stage 3) and back. It goes from Stage 1 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 3 -> Stage 2 -> Stage 1 -> REM Sleep. The cycle then repeats. The total cycle last around for 2 hours and repeats 3 or 4 times throughout the sleep. REM sleep is the stage of sleep where dreams occur, and the brain waves at this stage are very similar to that of the awake brain.

One crucial endogenous pacemaker, which are the internal factors that influence the sleep wake cycle, is the SCN. This pacemaker controls the release of melatonin, which affects when you feel sleepy. Before starting the night shift the SCN was releasing melatonin at night, which is now making her feel drowsy. Further, the exogenous zeitgeber (an external factor influencing the cycle) of light will affect her ability to sleep during the day as light inhibits the production of melatonin. Her endogenous pacemakers and exogenous zeitbegers are out of sync with each other, so Sam should try blackout blinds to keep her sleeping environment dark, and find other zeitgebers to associate with her new sleep pattern (eating meals consistently before sleep). This process of synchronising them is called entrainment.






One side of the neurone has receptors and the other side has vesicles filled with neurotransmitters. This means that receptors are always
