compliance - they just go along with it, internal thoughts are unchanged
identification - short term internal thoughts are changed but long term nothing changed
internalisation - they fully believe it long term and short

compliance - asch
identification - milgram
internalisation - 


Josie displays compliance as her private thoughts do not match how she displays publically. Hana displays identification, conforming based on what other people do but not necessarily internalising it as part of her belief system - she only acts like that when a part of the group. By figuring it out through trial and error Caitlyn will internalise the way she does things as believing that that is the right thing to do will become a part of her belief system.


A critisism of these types of conformity is that there is overlap meaning that it can be hard to classify an action into being just one type of conformity. Nuances and individual differences can cause conformity to fall somewhere between two types, suggesting that maybe the types are incomplete.
