Equity Theory

Equity theory focuses on the principle partners aim to put the same amount of effort that they put into the relationship back. Relationships can suffer if one person either under-benefits (they feel unloved) or over-benefits (they feel guilt).

Social exchange theory involves weighing up the costs and rewards of being in a relationship, and says that the relationship should continue if you are making a "profit", or end if you are making a loss ie. more cost than reward.

Both of these theories provide an economic model for the maintenance of relationships.


One difference between Social Exchange Theory and Equity Theory is that social exchange theory believes that you should try to make a profit in a relationship in terms of the cost and rewards, whereas equity theory says that the relationship should be fair for both partners. The relationship will suffer if the partner is either under or over-benefiting. 


S - Just quite nice
L - Correlational, equatibility could come as a result of happiness
I - An implication of this research is that it can be used in couples therapy.
C - Social exchange theory is another theory.
K - Relies on self reporting making less empirical
E - Potentially sensitive subject could break all these marriages
R - Stafford and Canary investigated the role of equity in marriage satisfaction 



16 Marker psychopathology


Ellis established his ABC model of depression. The A stands for activating event, in the diary extract this would be the dropping the change at the till. The B stands for belief, this is the belief that stems from the event, in this case the person that they are useless. This is often irrational, which is the cause of negative feelings towards the self. These beliefs form a negative schema about the world, and the self, and the future, as highlighted by Becks similar negative triad model. C stands for consequence, which is the behavioural result of these beliefs, which would be the symptoms of depression such as low mood and apathy. Ellis thought that irrational beliefs led to depressive symptoms, whilst rational beliefs led to positive consequences such as improved self-esteem.

A weakness of the ABC approach is that it is correlational. Whilst people might have these beliefs that come as a result of an activating event, it is unclear whether those beliefs cause the depression or the depression causes the belief. For this reason the model might not address the root cause of these irrational thoughts, but the symptoms of the irrational beliefs.

There are other theories that provide an explanation for depression. A biologist approach to depression links the lack of serotonin during neurotransmation to be the cause of depression. This can be caused by genetic predisposition like a problem with the SERT gene. These biological explanations have led to drug therapies using SSRIs which increase the amount of serotonin that reaches the post-synaptic neuron by preventing re-uptake. This suggests that the ABC model of depression is incomplete and doesn't provide a full model

There are practical applications to Ellis' model, that might help those that suffer from depression. An extention of the ABC model is the ABCDEF where the DEF refers to methods that can be taken as a part of cognitive behavioural theory to help treat the depression. With the help of a therapist their beliefs about the event can be Disputed. The psychologist then makes them the scientist where they find Evidence, which might change their Feelings. There has been research evidence to show that therapy using this method is beneficial, which adds legitimacy to Ellis' model.
