In the fashion world, almost every brand and designer contribute to the massive environmental damage or otherwise connected to scandal. As a result, looking to established designers for inspiration is more often disenchanting than encouraging. However, Vivienne Westwood is a designer that I can look to without feeling that sacrificing my morals for a chance at success in the fashion industry is inescapable. 
Born in 1941, Vivienne grew up in London and enrolled in art school. She dropped out after one term, saying; "I didn't know how a working-class girl like me could possibly make a living in the art world". In the early 70s she proved her younger self wrong by joining Malcom McLaren in making and selling clothes suited to the ‘Teddy Boys’ subculture, which later turned into their shop SEX. The shop's place in the punk scene boosted her fashion career to new heights.
Something I especially like about Vivienne’s designs are that they are made to say something - especially in her early years in the punk scene. She said in an interview: “I didn’t consider myself a fashion designer at all at the time of punk. I was just using fashion as a way to express my resistance and to be rebellious.” I think this attitude is core to why Vivienne’s designs have been so successful – it gives the clothes some purpose instead of just existing for the sake of selling something. In the way fashion and trends work today, personal style and meaningful clothing is a rarity as we beardly have time to decide if we like something before it goes in and back out of style again.
