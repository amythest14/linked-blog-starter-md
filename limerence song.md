lovesick
lungs thick
drowning on you
spluttering
heart fluttering
weighing down on me
your hands around my neck
tighter and tighter
finally touched by you
i feel sick thinking about you
i can't stop thinking about you
i might die thinking about you
enough thoughts for the both of us
i am reliant on you
i am nothing without you
i'm drowning on you 
till you say may name
and i'm floating on you
i don't want you
i want you to want me





went out to eat 
came back in 
and she was on my mind
woke up again
thinking that i'd kill myself
if she left me behind

i'm drowning on her
lungs thick, love sick
spluttering, heart fluttering
i'd die without her
but when i die 
i hope its her hands around my neck
tighter and tighter
and i'd pretend that it was sex
as i finally feel her touch
she thinks i'm too much
but maybe she's
not enough not enough
not enough not enough

cause i don't want you
i want you to want me
and i don't want you to
feel weird around me

but it's too late for that
i didn't joke but i'm pretty sure you laughed

i might die thinking about you
what you'd think about me
after i'm gone and i'm dead and it's 
your fault i wasn't happy
were you a lover of sorts
or just someone to be mad at me
always spilling guts
its ok i had enough thoughts 
for the both of us

i dreamt there was a girl
with pretty hair and pretty clothes
and she liked the same music as me
and i could be her girl
friend and i would be her cho-
-sen 


and she'd laugh at my jokes [cpd vbez]
and listen to my music
and at least pretend to care

she'd write me notes
and it'd be confusing
why you would always be there

thought i learned
thought that i grew
guess i don't deserve
to stop needing you

and i don't expect things to change
i don't expect you to start caring
i don't expect to move on
but i can try to be less overbearing
i don't blame you
but please try to be honest
am i delusional
in thinking you want it
you said that want it
but the way that you act 
i can't tell if you're honest
to anyone else mixed signals
wouldn't be good enough
