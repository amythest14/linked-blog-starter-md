Interactions with transphobes often result in them asking questions like - "What is sex?", or "What is a woman". And it's often hard to come up with a satisfying answer to that. Why? Because defining words in a language is an incredibly tricky task, espcially when trying to encompass an entire field of gender studies and simplify a whole continuum into a few words. The purpose of dictionaries is fundamentally to appeal to the large audience, favouring brevity and simplicity, sometimes at the consequence of the finer details of accuracy. The definition of a woman, according to the Oxford English Dictionary - is "An adult female human being." 
This definition in term relies on the definition of female - primarily defined as "of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) that can be fertilized by male gametes."
Is that the question "What is a women?" finally answered then? By simply looking at the dictionary. To be a woman you must bear offspring or produce eggs. Trans women are out of the question then! Not really. This is exclusionary to infertile women, and is not what the dictionary actually says. It says a female is someone "of the sex" that can do these things. So we must then define sex. The dictionary says thats "either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and most other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions."
Okay. Thats not clear. "On the basis of their reproductive functions" gives no way of assessing sex. It's very vague. It seems to imply that you must be able to reproduce, to be of a sex - but remember that the definition of female said you just had to be "of that sex" that did all these female type things - where do all these infertile or intersex or transgender women who don't meet that definition fit in? It's not clear. It would be inaccurate to say that an infertile woman isn't a women no matter what this dictionary implies - just as I believe its inaccurate to say that a trans woman isn't a woman. The truth is, words and the way they are used and defined is messy. The only fact is, a woman is a woman. Sex is sex. These word mean things, not because of what some book says, but because of what they intrinsically are. 
Or- something transphobes are extremely unable to do, you could look down the page to the second definition of female, and see that a female is something "relating to women or the female gender". So what is gender? "The male sex or the female sex, especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones, or one of a range of other identities that do not correspond to established ideas of male and female." Okay so now we are getting more of a holistic view of what words actually mean. Sex isn't just sex. There is context. Gender and sex are social. They are cultural. They rely on perception. And moreover, they are complicated. 
Something that transphobes also fail to consider is, trans people exist. That's a fact. There exist people who identify and live as a gender not assigned to them at birth. They live as women and are percieved as women - and such they are women.
