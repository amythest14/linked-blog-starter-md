the head of the list is doubled, then the function is map function is called on the tail of the list, such that it gets smaller each time. Due to the recursive nature of this, this happens until the tail is just an empty set and all the elements have been doubled. The definition for the map function with an input of an empty set then returns an empty set, giving the final returned list.
