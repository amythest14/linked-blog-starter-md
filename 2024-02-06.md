I concluded that the most likely system to be dominant in the future was 12-TET, due to its current tight integration into the musical landscape and decent approximation of just intonation which is furthered by socialisation. I also looked at limitations of this system, such as its roots in colonialism and bad approximations of some just intervals. Overall it definitely was the most likely option, due to its current dominance combined with the stagnation of tuning in the recent musical landscape.

  

The second most likely system to be dominant is Microtonality, as it allows for incresed levels of expression and accuracy compared to 12-TET, though it is held back by the lack of accessiblity due to the price of the specialised instruments required. It also allows for complex harmony not accessible in 12-TET by approximating 7-limit intervals

  

The least likely factor that I evaluated, is Just Intonation, which whilst it does have mathematically perfect intervals, it can only be in tune in one key at a time which gives it not much practical use. 

  

Overall, I concluded that there should be a push for the use of different tuning systems, as historically multiple systems have coexisted. This would allow artists to pick the most appropriate tool for the given task, and whilst 12-TET might remain the standard there should be effort made within the music production industry to make instruments and software support more compatible with alternative tuning systems. Considering just one dominant system however, 12-TET is by far the most likely option.

  

  

The process of writing the report has forced me to learn a number of new skills, and refine existing ones. Prior to writing my EPQ report I had no experience in referencing. Through the process I learned how to format citations using Harvard style referencing, which I learned to automate slightly using online tools such as MyBib which automatically format citations. I learned the when I need to footnote my report with a source, including providing sources for figures.

  

I also learned a number of immensely helpful skills related to researching. Whilst I had done some limited research prior to this EPQ for my other subjects, I learned to further not only the depth of my research but the breadth too. I found a wide range of sources that utilised different formats such as journal articles, books, videos, and news articles. During my initial resource phase I discovered various resources, both general ones like Google Scholar and more specialised ones such as the Huygens-Fokker foundation which provides a comprehensive list of thousands of sources that specifically focus on tuning systems. This allowed me to gain substancial amount of knowledge about the specialist topic of my report, which I was able to put into practice through the explanation and evaluation of different sources throughout my report. Overall my researching was a great strength of my report, as the specialised papers I found pushed my knowledge on my subject beyond the basic level presented in most books, and gave me a much more nuanced understanding. Subtopics within my factors allowed my to perform research on various areas that weren’t necessarily completely about tuning systems. For example, I explored the maths of acoustics including complex graduate-level mathematics like the Fourier transform. Another example is my research into the colonialism and imperialism. It was this reading that went beyond the basics of just tuning systems themselves that gave me such a breadth of research - not just breadth in format, but also in topic.

Writing the 5000 word essay for my EPQ gave me the experience to become very proficient at essay writing. Despite not taking any essay subjects at A-Level, I learned how to effectively evaluate when writing essays. I learned how to structure essays to have good pacing and flow, by breaking up the large word count into 3 three factors, each with their own topics that have clear arguments and counter-arguments. The use of conclusions at the end of each factor helped establish a clear line of argument throughout the report as a whole. I kept an academic and proffesional tone throughout the essay by avoiding the use of the first person, which kept the evaluation feeling relatively objective, rather than just being personal opinion. This strengthened the evaluation of my report, which was also helped by the use of statistics to keep the report analytical and empirical. An example of a statistic I used was the average handspan of pianist, to show the ineffectiveness of the piano as an instrument for microtonal tuning systems. 

As a part of my EPQ, I had the chance to work on my communication skills by giving a presentation about my topic. By talking about my project, both the content of the report and the process itself, I proved my deep knowledge about the topic by explaining the content of my report simply and consicely, despite the nerves I felt when presenting in front of so many people. I used concise notes that cued me on what the slide was about, without me having to directly read the writing on the slide, which helped to overcome my nerves when talking to a large number of people as I didn't have to remember everything I wanted to say off by heart. This was also helped by the rehearsal of the presentation, which allowed me to discovered the weakest parts of the presentation allowing me to refine it, as well as simply increasing my confidence.
