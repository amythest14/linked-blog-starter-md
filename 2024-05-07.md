Variations on Milgrams famous study showed that a major factor of obedience was uniform. When the researcher wore civilian clothes instead of a lab coat, the perception of authority was reduced and participants did not obey. This is the same thing that can be seen in this example is Natasha and Tanya don't respond to the commands of their teacher because he is in ordinary clothes. Another factor outlined by milgram as affecting obedience is location, with locations that do not match the perceived authority making obediance rates decreased. Other research also corrobarated this, as Bickmans study showed that someone who was generally seen as an authority figure would not cause people to conform. This effect can be seen in this example where the teacher who is generally an authority figure is not in the context in which they generally have authority so the students did not obey. /////

Theories exploring minority influence have suggested that there are three main factors that affect how successful the influence of minority groups is. The first of these is consistency, with theories suggesting that if minority groups maintain consistent in their beliefs then change is more likely to happen. The next are commitment, which says that if minority groups display self-sacrifice for their beliefs then it is more likely to influence the majority. Finally they need to show flexibility in what they hope to achieve, as this will allow for more people to get on board.
Studies have been done into the influence of consistency on minority influence. One study involved participants who believed they were taking part in a study on colour perception. A small section of the "participants" were confederates who in one condition consistently called slightly green blue colors green. This caused participants to eventually conform and agree that the blue colors were green. When the confederates were not consistent in this belief, this effect was reduced greatly. 
A limitation of this study is that it is a very unrealistic environment as they are just trying to convince the group of a trivial thing like colour perception. In real examples of minority influence, the cause is often political and involves things like fighting for equality and rights for marginalised groups. This has significantly more weight behind it as the cause they are fighting for significantly effects peoples lives. This shows that it may not be valid to apply this study to real world examples of minority influence. 
Additionally, in these real world examples of minority influence, the lines between minorty and majority is blurred. There may not be a significant difference in the numbers of the populations of each group, but rather the political power held by that group is what makes them the minority. An example would be the fight for womens rights, as women make up around half the population yet they are minorities due to their reduced political power. This draws further criticism to the validity of applying articificial studies like Moscovici's, as they do not represent  the complexities of minorities.
Another study highlighted the importance of flexibility. Nemeths study had a group of participants who had to agree on the amount of compensation they would give to a victim of an accident. One of the participants was a confederate who argued for a low rate of compensation. When they were inflexible in the amount of compensation they gave, they had little effect on the majority, whilst in the flexible condition the majority was far more likely to compromise and change their views. 
Some have critisised these theories of minority influence due to the seemingly contradictory nature of them. To be flexible in the goal implies changing their belief which makes it inconsistent. According to Moscovici's theory of consistency, the flexible condition in Nemeth should result in lower levels of change of majority opinion due to the change of beliefs - showing that their beliefs are inconsistent. This means that whilst each theory seems to have research to support it, taking them as a whole leads to inconsistencies which suggests that this model of minority influence is wrong, or incomplete. //////////////

Standardisation refers to controlling the procedure of the experiment such that participants all experience the same thing, apart from the potential change in dependant variable. This aims to eliminate confounding variables and improve reliability. In this experiment stnadardisation could have been achieved by having the book read be the same for all participants in that condition. //

5.

Randomisation refers to when an element of a study is decided through the use of chance. In this study participants could have been allocated to conditions through the use of a random number generator. //

The multi-store memory splits memory into 3 different sections: the sensory register, short term memory, long term memory. In group A, the words at the beginning of the list were in long term memory, likely due to rehearsal so these were able to be recalled. The words at the end of the list were remembered because these were still in short-term memory since words were recalled immediately. In group B, the words were not recalled immediately so the words at the end of the list left the short term memory, leading to only the words at the start being remembered - this is due to the short duration of the short term memory.  ////

Some psychologists have argued that anxiety reduces the accuracy of eyewitness testimony, due to a phenomenon called 'weapon focus'. In situations where a weapon is present, such as an armed robbery, the focus of onlookers is on the weapon due to their anxiety of getting hurt. This leads information about the identity of the perpatrator, and other details, to be lost. 
There is research to support this theory. One study involved a participant who thought they were in the waiting room for a study, but really the study had already started. They heard noises of fighting, and then in one condition a man rushes out holding just a pen, but in the other condition he is holding a knife. Participants were able to identify the man with a pen significantly more than when he was holding a knife. This shows that weapons focus does affect accuracy of eyewitness of testimony.
It can be drawn into question as to whether the weapon focus effect is actually due to anxiety. Some have claimed that weapons focus is more due to increased attention payed to the weapon due to it being more unusual of a scenario and thus demanding more attention, rather than creating anxiety in onlookers - and that anxiety in studies like this should be measured in an quantifiable way such as a correlation between heart rate and accuracy. If true, this would suggest that anxiety may not decrease accuracy of memory at all.
Other psychologists have proposed that increased anxiety actually increases accuracy of eye witness testimony as anxiety causes the fight or flight response to be triggered, causing people to have heightened senses that allow them to pay more attention to events happening and therefore can recall more. Research showed that witnesses of a real world violent crime recalled events with the same amount of accuracy when they were close to the action, compared to when they were watching from afar. This challenges the idea that anxiety decreases accuracy of eye-witness testimony. This research has more external validity than research into weapons focus as it focuses on a real violent crime, rather than one manufactured for the experiment - which could have led to demand characteristics being present.
To make sense of this contradictory research, psychologists proposed a model that explains that accuracy increases with moderate amounts of anxiety, but reduces with high amounts of anxiety due to them being overwhelmed. Understanding these effects of anxiety into eyewitness testimony has had practical implications as it is cast doubt on the recollections of witnesses on trial in high anxiety scenarios, with a witness no longer considered enough evidence to mark someone guilty due to understanding that factors such as anxiety might mean that recall of the event is inaccurate. This has had positive implications as less people are falsely imprisoned due to the impact of inaccurate eye-witness testimony. ////////////

The learning theory of attachment is a behaviourist theory that suggests that babies are conditioned to display attatchment to their mothers due to the fact that their mother gives them food. The pleasure (UCR) that comes from food (UCS) is associated with their mother (NS), such that their mother becomes a conditioned stimulus that evokes the pleasure of eating - which is what the learning theory says is the basis of attachment. This connection is then upheld with operant conditioning through leaving the mother (which deprives them of care), acts as a negative reinforcer - solidifying the attachment between mother and child. ////

Van Ijzendoorn conducted a metaanalysis of various recreations of Ainsworth's Strange Situation experiment from different countries, to explore how attachment differs with culture. He found that cultures that valued independance were likely to be seen as having an insecure-attachment type, as well as cultures that had less stigma around strangers due to children being raised in groups. This suggested that the classification of the strange situation was culturally biased. He also found that whilst attachment styles different based on country, it also different just as much within a single country, suggesting the existance of microcultures where parenting styles differ. ////

Bowlby's theory of maternal deprivation explored what would happen if there was long-term seperation between children and their mother, and the effects this would have on the child once they were grown.  12/16

Deviation from ideal mental health is where the someones behaviours or feelings differ from what are considered 'ideal' mental health. Psychologists have proposed criteria for ideal mental health that must be met to have . Dave shows this with his self-esteem issues, worrying about his body shape - poor perception of reality. He also finds it difficult to concentrate. ///

Failure to function has issues in the fact that it is hard to quantify where the cutoff point between functioning and not functioning is. This makes diagnosis based on this explanation unrealiable as different psychologists would have different ideas of what counts as functioning. This explanation is also androcentric, as women often are forced to function to support their children etc - which means that they wouldn't often be diagnosed even if suffering more. This means that failure to function might not to be a good definition of abnormality as it favors men over women. /////

procedural - how to do activities - playing piano; cases where people had amnesia losing episodic memories still could play the piano and tie their shoelaces

episodic - events in ones own life

semantic - facts; slightly more durable to amnesia than episodic

timestamped - episodic

case studies inherently have a sample size of one

episodic and semantic require conscious recollection wihlst procedural doesn't


clive wearing could still play the piano - meaning that the 

HM - could not form new memories but skills were still maintained after forgetting so the procedural memories were still intact.



She aqcuired episodic memories of swimming on her holiday
The activity of swimming is a procedural memory
the french words are semantic memories



primary data is data that is collected for the purpose of that specific study, whereas secondary data has been collected by someone else for a different person and is just being reused for this research. In this example the prison and court records are secondary data is they were not collected for this study, whereas the answers to the interview questions are primary data because it was gathered for the purpose of the study.

Thematic analysis could be done by transcribing the interviews and searching the text for themes that appear throughout. the text is then categorised into these themes. This is done to determines patterns within the text. 

The different between content analysis and thematic analysis is that in content analysis categories are determined before looking at the content and are counted to turn the data quantitative
