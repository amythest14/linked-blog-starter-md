One assumption of the cognitive approach is that mental processes can be simplified to models that feature an input and output along with mediatory steps - much like a computer.

Vicarious reinforcement refers to the when someones behaviour is formed through seeing another praised or punished for their actions. Social learning theorists show that the principles of operant conditioning are consistent even when watching a role model get punished or rewarded. The factors affecting the learning of a behaviour through vicarious reinforcement are attention, retention, ability to reproduce, and motivation. The motivation generally comes from seeing the punishment/reward.

A strength is that vicarious reinforcement has evidence - research by bandura. Differences in the role-models affect the resulting behaviour in the child. A limitation is that there are other explanations that could better explain the difference, such as the cognitive approach. This would explain the differences as the schema around working formed by exposure to their mothers views. Though similar to the SLT approach, a cognitive explanation would take into account the emotions and other internal mental processes not addressed.

The biological approach may suggest that these attitudes to work have genetic basis. The different genes caused by the daughters being from different familys would explain why their attitudes towards work are so different, as well as why they seem to align with their mothers views - they have inherited genes from their parents that affect their succeptibility to stress.

Cognitive neuroscience refers to the use of brain analysis to gain informations about cognitive processes. An example
