Behavioural categories are used so that behaviours observed by the researchers can be quantified. For example using event sampling and a behavioural category of 'hugging', then they would record each time a child hugs, thus ending up with numbers for each category meaning that they end up with quantitive data that will allow them to make conclusions on the effects of play area will have on friendly behaviours - allowing them to objectively compare the two conditions.

Two better examples could be hugging another child and high-fiving another child. These would be more valid to be used than the behavioural categories in table 1, because they are active actions associated with friendliness - rather than the passiveness that could result from any number of things in table 1. For example standing near to another child could be the result of unfriendly behaviours, such as a child standing close because they are about to hit another child.

To answer the question they need to perform a chi squared inferential test. This will produce an s value which they can then compare to a table of critical values for the condition for the right type of hypothesis, and the right number of participants (15), abd the 0.05 level of significance. If the s value is less than the critical value then the finding will be significant at the 0.05 level - so they can reject the null hypothesis else it is not significant so they would fail to reject the null hypothesis.

The opposite approach is an idiographic approach. This involves focusing on individuals, rather than patterns of behaviour throughout different people. In this case a study of friendly behaviour could have involved an interview with a child, asking questions about what behaviours they consider the most friendly etc.
