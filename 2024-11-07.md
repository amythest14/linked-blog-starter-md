Hi Mother, my voice hurts such that I can't properly talk to you - so I've put together a written response to some of the things you said. I apologise if it is emotionally charged, but I think that is a fair response to being shouted at and I hope you take on board the content of what I am saying.
I think it reflects on you as a person that you think the most appropriate time to shout at someone is when they are sick, when they are vulnerable. Right now it hurts for me to breathe, it hurts for me to talk, it hurts for me to think. But it hurts more when you shout at me when I'm feeling like this, and for what? Not doing enough to help? I've been completely bedridden for the past few days. You have not asked me to do anything beyond taking the dogs out. Which I did. And then you ask me to do more things on a piece of paper which I did not see. "When I'm sick I still have to cook you dinner and take you to school" - unfortunately thats the responsibility you sign up for when you choose to become a parent so I don't think is somthing that can really be used against me, but I am genuinely very grateful for all the times you have done that. Now that I'm older at capable of looking after myself I'm more than happy to cook for myself - and you - when you are sick, which is something I've done before and am more than happy to do anytime you are sick (I'm also happy to cook generally!). I think its very fair to to treated with a bit of leniency for the duration of ones illness. But maybe you mean not doing enough to help before becoming ill? 
Before me being ill, with one week of you being home seperating it, I have been at home on my own since the 16th of September - looking after the dogs for you. This involved me missing countless meetups with my friends, parties, just general social interaction - you name it.

You deny coming up with the idea of me staying at home, but you did - and I freely agreed to do so, as it'd save you lots of money with the kennel in the first place and would logistically make sense. You have never once thanked me for doing this (hugely hypocritical in my opinion given your outburst at Freya regarding her not thanking you well enough for her party). Going for over a month of my life in a big house hardly seeing another person is not an easy thing mentally, something you attested to when you were on your own for about 2 or 3 days this weekend, so you'd think that you'd be very grateful for me doing so! But no - you think that because I agreed to do it (or came up with the idea as you seem to think), that this doesn't require any appreciation whatsoever and doesn't count as me being helpful towards you. You've almost explicitly said that its my fault I'm stuck at home because I didn't learn to drive early enough for you, when you know full well the reason for this is that I was too stressed with my A-Levels. This is a cruel way of looking at the world.  I am happy to do look after the dogs for you, but doing it to be met with zero thanks or appreciation is disheartening, especially when it was to allow you to go off holidaying. Is appreciation not owed because I don't pay you rent? Is that your reasoning? Honestly I find that whole thing a major example of you frankly being just quite rude - and part of a running trend of you going out of your way to diminish everything I do to an extent that majorly affects my self-esteem and mental health. 
That all almost feels tangential, but I believe its wrong of you berate me for not helping directly after a month long investment of my life which obviously took mental toll in terms of lonliness etc for the expressed purpose of helping you - with almost no acknowledgement from you. If you think I was depriving myself of all human contant looking after the dogs for a month just for fun then you are mistaken!


But even when you are home, I am always happy to do things to help you and always do so when asked. I might not be the best at doing things without being asked, but that is something I'm trying to get better at and I do always do any job you ask me to do.
You are also angry at me for not having a job, which is fair! I want a job too! I've been applying to everything that it makes sense for me to apply for! It just seems that it's genuinely not easy to get a job when you have no proper experience. And to be honest I've used CVs with unfalsifiable lies about volunteering/babysitting experience (as unethical as I'm sure that may be) to help get me employed and it doesn't help! I've looked at a number of my friends CVs and mine is infinitely better presented - just without the actual previous work experience. I'm sure I would like some help from you, but shouting at me and saying you'll force me to do things is really not helping anyone.
In short, if you want us to have a good relationship, please wait till I'm not ill to shout at me. Otherwise it makes me feel very bad
