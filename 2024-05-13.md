CBT is a cognitive therapy for treating depression. It asks the client to play an active role that involves them disputing negative thoughts, through data gathering, which could involve keeping a diary for the therapist to look at together so they can talk about thoughts and events that occured, and 'patient as scientist'. This involves the client acting as a scientist, having a hypothesis based on their negative thoughts. For example, the patient in the extract wrote "everybody knew i was useless". They could treat this as a hypothesis that they could test through various methods such as simply asking people what they thought. If they do not think they were useless then this disproves their hypothesis and shows that their thoughts were irrational which becomes a process of cognitive restructiving where through rational thinking the negative schema are replaced with objective ones.

There is research to support the effectiveness of CBT therapy. March showed that over 85% of patients showed significant improvement after CBT therapy. This gives legitimacy to CBT as a treatment and indicates that it is good at treating patients with depression, which therefore makes it a very helpful treatment as it allows for a lot of people to recover from depression.

However, a major disadvantage of CBT is that it requires a lot of motivation and effort from the client, which is often impossible due to a symptom of depression being apathy and avolition. This means that people with more severe depression will not be able to complete or engage fully with CBT which will greatly limit how effective it ends up being. Other therapies such as drug therapy don't require motivation from the client and therefore may be more effective as a treatment as it can be taken by more people.

There have been economic implications as a result of the use of CBT. Whilst it is a expensive therapy compared to drug therapy as it requires a therapist to be paid, it is very effective at reducing the symptoms of depression which allow patients to return to work which has a positive impact on the economy. Whilst medication often needs to be continued to be taken for a long period of time, CBT provides clients with techniques that can continued to be used after the round of therapy is over, which may result in it being more cost-effective than drug therapies in the long term and thus will have an even greater positive impact on the economy.
