Flooding is a treatment of phobia that involves immediate exposure the patient with a worst-case scenario of their phobia. For example, if they have a fear of snakes they could be made to be in a small room with a snake or having a snake lie on them, They are expected to have an extreme fear response. Eventually though, they will get fatigued and no longer be able to exhibit the fear response. This leads being in the scenario without experiencing fear, which deconditions them of their phobia - potentially replacing the conditioned response of the feared object with relaxation instead of fear.


Anxiety hierarchy
Feared object is gradually introduced, only moves on when the patient is relaxed at that stage
reciprocal inhibition - relaxation


Desensitisation may be more successful because a less extreme fear response is elicited at each stage thus making it a more approachable form of therapy, as people with an extreme phobia will often not want to experience immediate exposure and therefore may not show up to a flooding session.



flooding is not appropriate for everyone as it requires experiencing an extreme fear response which some people may not be able to consent to, or they may not be physically able to handle it. people

Flooding is a treatment of phobia that involves an immediate exposure to what they are afraid of. They are forced to stay in the scenario and expected to have a severe fear response. Eventually though, they will become fatigued and the fear response will become exhausted. In this way counter conditioning will take place as they experience the feared object along with no fear response - they may be conditioned through this into even feeling relaxed in the presence of the feared object. In this case, Saira's fear could be treated by putting her in a small locked room with a cat - and then she would be kept in there until she is completely relaxed. This works off the  of reciprocal inhibition

SSRI - inhibits the reuptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft, giving them more time 
antipsychotics - blocks the receptors so that transmitters cannot bind and the impulse - atypical blocks them very temporarily then lets some in whereas typical block them permanantly
COMT gene - variations reduce enzymes that break down dopamine thus increasing levels of dopamine
MAOA gene - variations reduce enzymes that break down serotonin which increases aggression
SERT gene - Reduces the transportation of serotonin
