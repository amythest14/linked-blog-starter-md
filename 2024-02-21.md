Discuss the frustration aggression hypothesis in relation to human aggression. 

This explanation of aggression suggests that aggression is a result of the frustration caused by the prevention of people getting what they want. When someone has a drive to a goal, and they are met with an obstacle. Catharsis, a psychodynamic concept, is achieved once aggression has been released. 
There is research that supports the frustration aggression hypothesis. Studies involving participants having to solve an impossible jigsaw puzzle administered higher level of electric shocks towards another person, compared to a control. This suggests that the prevention of finishing the jigsaw puzzle lead to the aggression.
