A queue is a first in first out structure 

a linear queue can be visualised as a line of data 

a circular queue can be visualised as a ring of data

 they both use pointers to designate where the front and rear of the queue is

a priority queue is similar to a linear queue but adds a priority ranking to each data element

The number in subscript indicates the priority

the highest priority data items are removed first

where priority is the same, the first in first out principle applies
