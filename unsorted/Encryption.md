The Vernam cipher is an example of a class of encryption techniques known as one time pad techniques


the key that is used is a sequence of letters that should be as long as the plaintext that is being encoded

the key can be recorded on a pad 

for maximum security, a particular key should only be used to encrypt one message, hence the name one time pad

to encrypt a message, each character in the plaintext is combined with the character at the corresponding position in the key

converting the corresponding plaintext and key characters into a binary code

use a logical XOR on these binary representations to produce a new binary code, which in turn maps back to a character
