Encapsulation refers to the [[Object-Oriented Programming]] concept of bundling variables and methods into objects. This allows the ability to hide the internal features of the class, allowing the user to only use a public interface. It reveals just the information needed to reuse its members through the public interface without sharing any private implementation details.
