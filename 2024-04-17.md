A token economy is used to manage schizophrenia, using the principles of operant conditioning. A token is presented for desirable behaviour such as brushing teeth or going to sleep on time. An amount of tokens can then be exchanged for a reward, such as a bar of chocolate. The token here is a secondary reinforcer, but is associated with the eventual reward so that would ideally lead to increased behaviour. This is an example of positive reinforcement as they get a reward that will help them to repeat those actions. This helps manage schizophrenia as due to avolition many of these tasks may be hard to accomplish so these will help encourage patients.

Effective in helping return to normal life

does not treat schizophrenia, only manages the effects
these may be better treated by putting more emphasis on treating the schizophrenia itself
might not help with severe schizophrenia - ]

A token economy is used to manage schizophrenia, using the principles of operant conditioning. A token is presented for desirable behaviour such as brushing teeth or going to sleep on time. An amount of tokens can then be exchanged for a reward, such as a bar of chocolate. The token itself is a neutral stimulus, and is a secondary reinforcer, but is associated with the eventual reward (positive) so that would ideally lead to increased behaviour. This is an example of positive reinforcement as they get a reward that will help them to repeat those actions. This helps manage schizophrenia as due to avolition many of these tasks may be hard to accomplish so these will help encourage patients. When Sarah earns a token redeemable for rewards such as extra time, this shows that she is taking part in a token economy, as she is experiencing positive reinforcement. The effectiveness of token economy in managing schizophrenia is shown be Sarah's symptoms becoming more managable. When Sarah transitions to outpatient care with newfound coping skills, this highlights a key aim of token economies - making synonyms more managable for when hospital is left


symptom overlap - easy to misdiagnose as something else, meaning they get the wrong treatment
culture bias - might lead to diagnosis where is not necessary or vice versa
gender bias - need to function therefore dont meet the criteria for failure to function and that makes it 
comorbidity - leads to misdiagnose
unstable diagnosis over time - lack of clarity in diagnostic criteria
diagnosis is different between psychiatrists - they can't both be right, one might lead to inappropriate treatments



Discuss issues surrounding the classification and diagnosis of schizophrenia, referring to Mark in your answer.

Comorbidity and symptom overlap lead to sissues with misdiagnosis, which leads to patients receiving the wrong treatments.

Patients should ideally receive the same diagnosis over time (unless they recover), and by different psychologists. If this doesn't happen it means that diagnosis has been inconsistent and patients may not be getting the help they need
