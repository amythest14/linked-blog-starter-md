  

People like me and you, we should say things to one another.

everything you’re going to say, i already know.. we’ve had enough bad timing

 if you have ever loved me in any way, you will come back
 
4 and a half billion years

why would you even do that do yourself

you have a duty of care i know, which you take very seriously

i have a duty of care  

The universe is over! It doesn't have a say any more! We're standing on the last ember, the last fragment of everything that ever was. As of this moment, I'm answerable to no-one! 

Tell me what they did to you. Tell me what happened to the Doctor?

you. i had to find a way to save you!

Now, you listen to me. You're going to be alone now, and you're very bad at that. You're going to be furious and you're going to be sad, but listen to me. Don't let this change you.

The Hybrid. Five minutes to hell. I think it's time to tell the truth.

  

Companions who are willing to push each other to extremes

  

Clara's my friend. 

  

I know. And you're willing to risk all of Time and Space because you miss her. One wonders what the pair of you will get up to next.

  

After all this time, after everything I've done, don't you think the universe owes me this? 

  

Because we know summer can't last forever. 

  

Of course it can. You just have to steal a time machine. 

  

  

  

you’ve broken every code you’ve ever lived by

  

They said, your lot, that if you saved me, Time would fracture. What does that mean? 

  

  

  

I can save you.

  

There was only one way to keep Clara safe. I had to wipe some of her memory.

  

But I can remember, Clara.You don't understand, I can remember it all. Every time. And you'll still be gone. Whatever I do, you still won't be there. 

  

I reversed the polarity.

  

I'm not even sure that you can. It'll do something to one of us. Better than flipping a coin.

  

Look how far I went, for fear of losing you. This has to stop. One of us has to go.

  

I don't think I could ever forget you.

  

Clara, I don't think you're ever going to have to.

  

you can’t see me can you. you look at me and you can’t see me. dyou have any idea what thats like

  

She could be anyone, right? You don't know who you're looking for. I mean, she could be me, for all you know.

  

There's one thing I know about her. Just one thing. If I met her again, I would absolutely know.
