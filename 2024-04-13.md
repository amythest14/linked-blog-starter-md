transmission control protocol

a set of networking procotols consisting of four layers working together

all incoming and outgoing data packets pass up and down through the various layers when you communicate on a network


application 
transport
network
link



application layer - using appropriate protocol relating to whatever application is being used to transmit data. For example in a web browser this could be http, https, ftp, etc. this is added to the header

transport - tcp part. establishes an end to end connection and splits the data to be transmitted into packets. it adds to the header of each packet, the sequence number of the packet, the total number of packets, the port number the packet should use,, etc.

network layer - ip part. adds the source ip and destination ip to each packet. routers operate at this layer, using the ip address to know the destination the packets are heading to. socket = ip address + port and tell the recipient which program the incoming data is for. 

link layer - this represents the physical connection between network nodes. It adds a unique MAC address of the source and destination device. The mac address is changed at each hop on the route. 

At each connection in the network (for example routers), the link layer of the packet is stripped and the network layer is looked at to determine the new destination. The packet then goes through the link layer again for the next step in the travel.

At the end the data is stripped at the recipient computer layed by later until the required data is alone returned to the correct program.
