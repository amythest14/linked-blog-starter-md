YOU! ME! NOW!
take me back down
back into your arms
where you tell me your deepest secrets
and so i promise 
if you can believe it
that i won't remember in the morning

and you look just a painting
if you can believe it

and every sentence ends with ellipsis 
and we can see
from your lipstick who your lips kissed
im on fire and im burning all our bridges
i love you but you're in love with contradictions
you! me! now!
i don't believe this

and every sentence ends with ellipsis 
and we can see
from your lipstick who your lips kissed
im on fire and im burning all our bridges
i love you but you're in love with contradictions


your head is spinning trying to be patient
you like me more when i don’t take my medication
you’re telling me to stop avoiding the conversation
i’ve been trying to describe the sensation
of being in love with you
equal parts drowning and elation







we’re a tritone apart i can’t help but feel diminished
fifth time this week you’ve told me that we’re finished
talking on our friends like they mean something to you
can't trust my brains or my body because of you
guess that i'm not special guess that i'm just bitches
bitches that won't leave cause you still send me your pictures
