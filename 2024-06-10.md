\A data structure is a method of representing data that organises and stores data in a way that it can be efficiently accessed and manipulated.

An array is a data structure with a fixed size that stores indexed elements in contiguous blocks of memory.

Fields are pieces of a data in a data structure. Methods are functions that operate on the data. An example data structure could be a table, with a linked list of linked lists being the fields, and a getcell() and setcell() being used to retrieve and modify the data in the fields.



string[] sports = { "rugby", "football", "hockey", "netball", "cricket" }

The first element of the array has an index of zero, rather than one.

Console.Writeline(sports[0] + sports[4])

sports[1] = "gymnastics"

iterate over each element in the array using a for loop with a variable going from 0 to 5 and incrementing each loop. that variable is used as the index such that the whole array is printed.

replace the 5 in the for loop with sports.length()

intractable is k^n


iterate over all the items of the list, checking whether each item is equal to the item that is being searched for. If they are equal then it has been found. If not equal then it continues onto the next element. If it reaches the end of the list without finding an equal data,
