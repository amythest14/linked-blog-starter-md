recalling from different perspective (disrupts schema of event)
recalling in a different order (disrupts schema of event)
avoiding interrupting (to not interrupt recall)
avoiding leading questions (avoid bias from the interviewer)
asking for every detail whether relevant or not (small details can provide retrieval cues that might lead important details to be remembered)
returning to the scene of the crime - mentally/physically (acts as a retrieval cue) - context reinstatement


Critisism of studies into short-term memory lack mundane realism such as recalling word lists do not reflect the things that people recall in the real world, such as a phone number meaning that the task lacks ecological validity. When people are given a task on memory they often display are competitive and get the best score they can. This is an example of demand characteristics and shows that the way people recall memory in a research study may not reflect how memory is reflected in the real world.





Post event discussion

Discuss how post-event discussion can affect EWT

Theories into the factors affecting the accuracy of eye-witness testimony have suggested that when witnesses are allowed to discuss the events with each other, this will introduce innacurate information due to memory conformity and instroductions of false memories. 
There is research to support this theory - Gabbert's study into post-event discussion showed that when participants who watched the a video of a crime take place, and were allowed to discuss with each other after watching the video, introduced false information in 71% of particiapants. This highlights how vulnerable memory is to being altered, and how post-event discussion can reduce the accuracy of eye-witness testimony. Studies like this have been critisised for their articificial environment - watching a video rather than being witness to real crime, which means that it may not represent how witnesses act in real scenarios as there will be other factors that will affect how people discuss after a crime, such as shock causing people to not talk. The artificial environment also creates the opportunity for demand characteristics to become present, as participants may feel that they are meant to talk to each other, affecting how they discuss compared to how witnesses discuss in the real world. These limitations means that the influence of post-event discussion may be limited. 
This theory has had practical applications, as police now know that to ensure the highest level of accuracy in recall they can split witnesses up to avoid the contamination of memories through post-event discussion. This has real world consequences in increasing the accuracy of testimonies and therefore reducing false imprisonments, which have been widespread historically due to the inaccuracies of eye witness testimony.
There are other explanations for the limited accuracy of eye-witness testimony that may provide better explanations. For example, the Yerkes-Dobson curve provides a detailed model for how different levels of anxiety impact memory performance. Anxiety is often unavoidable for witnesses to crimes and it is therefore more important to understand how it works as this will likely always affect the accuracy of testimonies. This may be more important in the current context of police investigations as witnesses are generally seperated due to the research into post-event discussion. Because of this anxiety is likely to be a bigger factor in today's eye witness testimony.
