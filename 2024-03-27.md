When Dr Grant investigates the brain chemistry of people with depression this is reductionist as he is reducing the complexity of depression into the lowest explanation - brain chemistry.
Dr Austin did unstructured interviews to find about about general behaviour, which is holistic as he looks at the whole person, including many different parts of depression.

reductionist allows can be investigated on the level of one factor, allowing it to be inkvestigated without mmany extraneous variables making it more practical be be investigated. 
holism allows factors that may not have been considered to be contribute to the behaviour, which makes it more valid however this means that is not practical because behaviour cannot be isolated
