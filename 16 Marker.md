Outline research into the effect of situational variables on obediance and discuss what this tells us about why people obey.


Milgram investigated obedience in a study in which a confederate in a lab coat (researcher) instructed the participant (teacher) to administer electric shocks to another non-visible confederate (learner) if they got questions wrong - upping the voltage each time. If the teacher questioned the experiment the researcher would simply say "the experiment requires you to continue". An overwhelming majority of participants ended up giving a fatal shock to the learner, demonstrating the power of obediance. In variations of this study, there were a number of situational variables that were shown to affect the percentage of obediant participants. One such variable was the location in which the experiment took place, as less people administered the shock of 450 volts if it took place in a run-down office building compared to if it was in a well respected university. Other variable was the uniform of the researcher, if they werent wearing a lab coat then participants were much less likely to administer the 450 volt shock.  One other variable that affects obedience is proximity, as when the researcher was not in the room they were much less likely to give the shock. This suggests that a major reason why people obey is because increased authority of the person doing the ordering (as caused by a more reputable location or outfit) means they enter an agentic state, where they do not feel responsible for their own actions as they feel it is the fault of the person that ordered them. The participant may remain in the autonomous state if the researcher is less close, as they cannot pass of the responsibility to them.

One limitation of this research is that it lacks external validity. In day to day life, most people are not ordered to administer electric shocks to poeple, meaning the findings of this study may not be able to be extrapolated to how people respond to obediance in the real world. 
Milgrams study also demonstrated alpha bias, as all of the participants were men. This suggests that the findings may not explain how variables like location and proximity affect the whole population as this was only investigated in men. This means that research into variables affecting obediance may be flawed, and thus cannot tell the complete picture of why people obey.
