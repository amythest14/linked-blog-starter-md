Culture Bias

Free Will / Determinism 

free will is only present in the humanistic approach. examples that could be talked about is its importance in counselling motivating the patient to get better rather than the passive idea that things happen to you in alternative therapies like cbt.


Idiographic / Nomothetic

Again the humanstic approach is the only one that takes a idiographic approach. Practical applications cannot really be made when findings are not generalised to make a model. A nomothetic approach seen in basically all other approaches, take into account a number of peoples experiences which allow models to be created that can be applied to more people, allowing more people to be helped. 

Ethical Issues

The obvious thing to talk about here is studies into social influence, namely mr milgram and mr zimbardo.

Reductionism / Holism

Holism again the only approach this applies to is the humanistic approach and its good because not really anything. its bad because like how else are you going to look at behaviour like lmao? like i guess it focuses on lived human experience and all that shizz but really... do better. reductionism is quite simplistic in itself though, as reducing things to their basic components like the biological approach does leaves out the influence of the impact of higher level cognitive factors on behaviour that are hard to consider at such a low level. 


Nature / Nurture

Nature could talk about biological approach ykyk genes and shit very natural. For nurture probs best to talk abouttt
