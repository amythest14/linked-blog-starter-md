you don't say
i love you to friends
then why'd you say it to me
avoid me to the end
i swear you'd make enemies
if you weren't so-

i want it all
you won't get that
i go too far
n you won't get back

i'd love you more 
in a hole in the ground
you're fucking shit up
so i'll put you back down

you'll always haunt me but 
now you won't visit
you won't want me
when you're not living
