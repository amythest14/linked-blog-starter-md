outline counselling and compare with another form of therapy


Counselling is a talking therapy that is led by the client rather than the therapist. It involves building a strong rapport with the therapist who will provide unconditional positive regard towards the client. This approach is more personable than other therapies like CBT which allows clients to become empowered to make their own changes. 


i would use an independant groups design, randomly allocating participants to either the new tv program or old tv program condition. I would use this design since it eliminates the order effects that would be present in a repeated measures design. I have chosen not to match the participants on a confounding variable such as age due to the increased time, cost, and complexity of this - and all the participants are preschool students so the variations in age would likely not be significant.

I would use a questionairre which uses closed questions about the childs social before. This is due to how quick and cost-efficient it is to distribute questionairres to each parent - compared to interviews which requires hiring interviewers.
