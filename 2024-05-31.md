### Classification of Schizophrenia

positive symptoms include: delusions and hallucinations
negative symptoms include: speech poverty, avolition

issues with diagnosis are low reliability caused by misdiagnosis due to comorbidity and symptom overlap
reliability can be assessed through interrater reliability or test-retest. these can show that there are issues with the reliability of diagnosis which implies that some people are misdiagnosed and therefore have had diagnoses with low validity. Gender and culture bias is another factor to consider in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, with women being underdiagnosed generally due to their ability to function in spite of their symptoms. People are colour on the other hand are more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia due to cultural bias and differences in cultural norms. Diagnoses have been shown to be most accurate when the race and gender of the patient matches that of the psychiatrist.
### Biological Explanations for Schizophrenia
The genetic explanation for schizophrenia suggests that schizophrenia is inheritable through genes. This is backed up by family studies which showed high levels of concordance in MZ twins, however this concordance was still not near 100% suggesting a diathesis stress model. The dopamine hypothesis says that imbalances in the dopamine levels within the brain is correlated and may cause schizophrenia. High levels of dopamine within speech centres are thought to be the cause of auditory hallucinations whereas low levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex is thought to be linked to negative symtoms like avolition. Anti-psychotics work by influencing the levels of dopamine in the brain which suggests that dopamine is the cause of the symptoms of schizophrenia. Enlarged ventricles have also been correlated with schizophrenia
### Psychological Explanations for Schizophrenia

meta-representation - can't tell whether thoughts were internal or external
family dysfunction - schizophregenic mother - double bind communication - expressed emotion

### Drug Treatments for Schizophrenia

Typical antipsychotics - side effects can be dehabilitating involuntary motor movements

Atypical antipsychotics - side effects can be rare but dangerous blood condition
