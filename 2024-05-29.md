### Neural and Hormonal
case study - Charles Whitman was a mass shooter who experienced very high levels of aggression. He was found after death to have had a brain tumor pressing on the Amagdyla. This give support to the belief that the amygdala was the part of the brain responsible for aggression. The amygdala is responsible for the fight or flight response, which is more easily activated in people succeptible to high levels of aggression. Aggressive people also had lower levels of activity in the pre-frontal cortex, responsible for decision making. This means that aggressive people have reduced impulse control. They were also found to have lower activity in the hippocampus, where long term memory resides. This showed the inability for these aggressive people to learn from mistakes. Collectively this is known as the limbic system and has been implicated as the reason for aggressive behaviours (abnormalities in the limbic system). However, this in of course correlational! People with increased levels of aggression have low levels of serotonin - serotonin calms aggressive impulses. The hormonal explanation for aggression says that the cause of aggressive behaviour is infact high levels of testosterone. This has face validity in the fact that the vast majority of aggressive people are male - having naturally higher levels of testosterone. Violent men were found to have more testosterone levels in their blood than non-violent men.
### Genetic Explanations
Variations in the MAOA gene mean that less of the enzyme that breaks down serotonin in the synaptic cleft is produced, and therefore there are higher levels of serotonin. This contradicted earlier evidence which suggested that it was low levels of serotonin rather than high that was responsible for aggressive behavior. However, some have suggested that this is because the high levels of serotonin mean that the receptors get desensitised and there is less of an inhibitory effect from the serotonin. Serotonin has been shown to calm aggressive impulses, so this means that the aggressive impulses are more likely to be followed through with aggresive behaviours.
### Ethology and Evolution
The evolutionary explanation for aggression suggests that one reason for aggression is an evolutionary response to the idea of a mans partner being unfaithful. The man does not want to put his time and resources into supporting a child that is not his, so he must use aggressive behaviours to scare off potential mates for his partner, and to scare his partner herself such that she will not seek another mate. This ensures that his genes will be the one to be passed on. The man will use mate retention techniques such as negative inducement to scare the partner into not being unfaithful. If the man discovers that cheating has taken place they will experience severe sexual jealousy in which they will carry out aggressive behaviours, such as physical abuse. This explanation can be seen as legitimisng domestic violence thus making it socially sensitive and potentially having ethical implications as it could give men the justification for abusing women.

The ethological explanation for aggression shows that in animals, aggression is a drive similar to hunger or sex drive. Normally this is suppressed, but a universal stimuli for that species will trigger an innate releasing mechanism which causes them to act out their aggression through an innate fixed action pattern. This may involve biting or other aggressive acts, but according to this theory these will be same throughout a species. This is an evolutionary response that all animals are innately born with.
### Social explanations of human aggression

There are a few social explanations for aggression.
These are social learning theory, deindividuation, and frustration aggression.

The frustration theory of aggression is a psychodynamic theory that suggests that the cause of aggression is the frustration caused by the inability to reach one's goals (the closer one if to their goals when this happens leads to more frustration and therefore potentially more aggression). Displacing this frustration onto something else and then carrying out an aggressive act towards it leads to cathersis, resolving this frustration. This has high face validity, as people often feel that they are aggressive after being frustrated. However this may not fully explain aggression as often those who are routinely aggressive do not appear to show catharsis after being aggressive, as this would stop them from carrying out their next aggressive acts. 

The social learning theory of aggression suggests that the principles of operant conditioning apply even when the reward for a behaviour is not personally experienced, but rather witnessed in a role model. With aggression, this means that people say others praised for aggression or have good outcomes from acting aggressively (be it in the media or in real life), and from this they learn to act aggressively themselves. This is evidenced by Bandura's bobo doll study.
