vectors can be represented as a 1d array.

a vector can represent a fuction - transforming an input to an output

the dot product is just multiplying the x components and then multiplying the y components and adding them together

the dot product can be used to find the angle between two vectors


convex combination is the area in which a vector could lie in the triangle between two other factors. this can be respresented in the form au+bv where a+b=1
