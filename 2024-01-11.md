Winch's research into filter theory found that similarity of interests, attitudes and personality were very important for the beginning of relationships and complementarity of needs had more impact on long term relationships. This suggests that filter theory can extent beyond the formation of relationships, and can have implications for the maintenance of long-term relationships. This is a strength of the model as this extension can have practical implications, for example with the development of dating apps, where to find good matches it is useful to be able to determine the compatibility in the long term as well as the short and this extension of filter theory can help with that. 
However, in filter theory formation of relationships go through a series of filters, first social demographic, then similarity in attitudes, and then complementarity. This can be criticised as it is not always linear, as the model suggests. Sometimes someone will initially "pass" the similarity filter, then the complementarity. However, as the relationship formation develops they find out more about their partner and might find out about an opposing view that would have failed the similarity filter if it was known about. This contradicts the linear nature of the model, suggesting it is an incomplete way to view the filtering of potential relationships. This also may contradict Winch's conclusions, as similarity in attitudes to continue to be important and can even be a dealbreaker even once complementarity has been established, as more attitudes get discovered.
