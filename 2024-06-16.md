TCP/IP STACK

the tcp/ip stack is a collection of protocols that in conjunction work to facilitate the transfer of data over a network.


APPLICATION

the application layer is the first layer of the TCP/IP stack is responsible for selecting a protcol to be used - the protocol used is specific to the application used for the data being transferred over a network. This could be things like HTTP or HTTPS for tranferring web pages, or FTP for transferring files. 

TRANSPORT LAYER

Features the TCP protocol, this is responsible for forming and end to end connection. It then is responsible for splitting the outgoing data into packets. This includes providing each packet with a packet number, the port number, and the total number of packets.

NETWORK

The network layer is responsible for handling the IP procotol. It adds information to the packets in a header such as the incoming and outgoing IP addresses, the size of the packet. routers operate on this layer.

LINK

The Link layer is responsible for the transferral of data to the next node in the network. it is the physical connection that could use ethernet or wifi to transfer the data. it adds the mac address for the source and destination.


at each node it goes back up the link layer to the network layer, such that it can be routed to the next node. it is then packages the new mac addresses and new information that will let it to go to the next node. It is only at its final destination that the packet is stripped of the data from all the layers, reaching the application layer of the recipient device which uses the specified protocol to be able to handle the recieved data.





DNS - domain name server

converts from website url, to the actual ip address used to transmit data

NAT - network address translation

converts from private ip address to public one through router/modem



DHCP - dynamic host configuration protocol

automatically assigns ip addresses  that are not currently used to devices on a network.
