### Evolutionary explanations for partner preferences

Men seek women who are likely to be fertile - 0.7 hip to waist ratio, large breasts, yet young face
Women seek men who can support a child - dominant features will help protect the family by fending off predators - wide shoulders, strong, etc. Men should have resources like money. Sexual selection. A downside of this approach is that is does not consider reasons for homosexual relationships.

Women are much more picky about who they made with than men because men have unlimited sperm whilst women have limited ova. Men need to compete with other men for a partner whilst women don't.

### Factors affecting attraction

Self-disclosure

Filter theory

physical attractiveness

matching hypothesis



### Models of relationships

social exchange theory - want to make the most profit from a relationship in terms off gains - losses

Equity theory - reduces feelings of guilt from the social exchange theory by instead considering that both parties should have the same amount of profit so neither feels dissatisfied

investment model - looks at the investments in a relationship to help todetermine whether alternatives would be viable



### Duck's model of relationship breakdown

 intra-psychic phase - admits dissatisfaction to ones self
dyadic phase - confronts partner
social phase - tells social circle 
grave dressing - moves on and focuses on positives of the relationship

the impacts of these different phases differ drastically due to age and situation which is a limitation of the model

### Virtual relationships

Absence of gating - the lack of usual filters especially those linked to social demography such as location etc make virtual relationships progress quicker than those that happen irl

Lack of visual cues

self disclosure
### Parasocial relationships

attatchment theory - insecure resistant attachment type is the most likely to form parasocial relationships (especially those that are borderline pathological)

Duck's phase model of relationship breadown is a stage model detailing how relationships break down. The first phase is the intra-psychic phase where one party admits to themselves that there is a problem in the relationship. The dyadic phase is next, and is where they confront their partner about their concerns about their relationship. This is the last chance to remedy the situation otherwise the relationship will end. The next phase is the social phase and involves telling their social circle that the relationship is over. The next phase is the grave-dressing phase which involves retrospectively looking at the relationship with a distorted perspective painting yourself as the good person in the relationship, whilst considering all the lessons learned from it. 
A limitation of the phase model for relationship breakdown is that not all relationships breakdown slowly in this way. Another way relationships can end is through 'sudden death', where an event such as cheating leads to the relationship ending immediately without going through the phases outllined in Duck's model. Additionally individual differences, especially with factors like age and location, can mean that the stages of Duck's model have less of an effect on the relationship breakdown. For example in younger couples, the social phase has been shown to be less distinct than in older couples. This suggests that there are factors which might affect the validity of Duck's model in explaining relationship breakdown. There have been practical applications of Duck's model, as understanding that the dyadic stage is the opportunity for the relationship to be saved has helped in relationship counselling to recover struggling relationships.
