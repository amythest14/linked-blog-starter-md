1. The hypothesis should be directional as there is previous research which suggests that we prefer disclosures to be reciprocated.

2. There will be a significant increase in the enjoyment score of self-disclosure when it is reciprocal compared to non-reciprocal.

4. Sign Test - It has a independent design meaning that it is a related, and it uses nominal data as there are categories of increase, decrease, and no change. This means that the sign test is the most appropriate test to use.

5. S value is 2, as this is the sign number of times the least frequent category changed sign.
6. These findings are significant at the 0.05 level as the S value is equal to the critical value
7. This research has not been counterbalanced so there could be order effects, as the participants may get bored or used to the self-disclosure.
8. Spearman's Rho. This is a correlation as it is assessing the relationship between intimacy score and the number of months the couples had been in a relationship. It uses ordinal data as it is using a scale for intimacy score that is not intervalic in its spacing. 
9. These findings are significant as the critical value is 0.648 which is less than the calculated value of 0.652

Discuss self-disclosure as a factor affecting attraction in romantic relationships. (16 marks)

Self-disclosure is a factor affecting attraction in romantic relationships. People who are more open about themselves and their feelings show greater levels of intimacy in their relationships. People tend to disclose to their partners more when their partners disclose themselves, leading to a mutual bonding experience. Collins and Miller's meta-analysis into self-disclosure supports the idea that self-disclosure plays a central role in the development and maintenance of relationships. The disclosure led to even more intimacy when the information shared was private and was not shared to other people.
