SSRIs inhibit the reuptake of serotonin back to the vesicles so serotonin stays in the synaptic cleft longer, leading to more chance of them binding to the receptors

Both typical and atypical antipsychotics work on the post-synaptic neurone, blocking receptors to limit the amount of dopamine that binds. However atypical antipsychotics only block the receptors temporarily allowing some neurotransmitters still bind.
