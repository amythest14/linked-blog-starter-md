if i said i dont like you
even though its a lie you
would still be right there

i dont want to fight you
its the middle of the night
and im
so tired

so what the fuck was i supposed to do
you expected me to just stop wanting you?
so what the fuck do you want to do
keep pretending that you don't feel it too
what do you expect me to do
i couldnt bring myself to
 just not acknowledge you

got no clue what you want
or how you’re so nonchalant
making me feel like this

i’m reeling alive cause i
feel you inside and i 
pretend that it doesn’t mean shit

i'll take back everything i said
but not everything i did
i hope you'll
understand
so i'll keep provoking you
remind you of things that i wrote to you
till i know where you stand

so what the fuck was i supposed to do
you expected me to just stop wanting you?
so what the fuck do you want to do
keep pretending that you don't feel it too
what do you expect me to do
i couldnt bring myself to
 just not acknowledge you

your words are abrasive
you just want to say shit
not a promise if you break it 
its not break up

you said that i looked pretty
or pretty bad i don't recall
convincing myself  the former
becomes increasingly more effortful

so what the fuck was i supposed to do
you expected me to just stop wanting you?
so what the fuck do you want to do
keep pretending that you don't feel it too
what do you expect me to do
i couldnt bring myself to
 just not acknowledge you
