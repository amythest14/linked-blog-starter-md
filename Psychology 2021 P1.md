Question 1

Zimbardo investigated conformity to social roles by reconstructing a prison environment, which he populated with two groups of participants: prisoners and guards, with the guards instructed to act like prison guards. The prisoners were stripped of all clothes and given numbers and identical clothes to dehumanise them similar to a real prison. He then observed how the guards responded to this situation, and to the degree they conformed to the idea that they had of what prison guards were like, ie aggressive and cruel to the prisoners.

Question 2

The movement against single use plastic started as a small group of people trying to raise awareness of the harms that they cause. This followed the normal process of minority influence whereby through consistency, compromise and commitment led to a snowball effect where more and more people got convinced of the harm of plastics and they told more people. This gets to the point where there is economic pressure on companies to reduce their plastic usage otherwise they may face boycotts etc. This leads to the use of single use plastics becoming the majority view.

Question 3

Primary data is data that directly comes from in this case the questionaire for the specific purpose of the study at hand. A limitation of this type of data is that it is unpractical to get a large sample size whereas secondary data has lots of large data from censuses etc.

Question 4

Do not feature open questions in the questionaire, instead gathering quantitative data. This is easier for particpants to fill out so they will be able to give more accurate results. It could also be improved by keeping the questionaire as brief as possible to keep the participants from getting fatigued and stop answering questions or putting less effort into the later questions.

Question 5

One explanation of obediance is legitimacy of authority. Milgrams study showed that authoritative figures lead to obediance in participants, with them giving fatal electric to the confederate at the request of an authority figure. Variations of this study have suggested that the obedience rate is dependant on the legitimacy of the authority. For example when the experiement was held at a run-down office block rather than in the prestigious Yale university, obediance dropped substantially.
There is further research to back this explanation of obedience. The study on location was not officially published so was not held to the same academic rigour as other studies. An example of such a study was another variation on Milgrams experiement, this time investigating the affect on uniform on obediance. When wearing an official uniform, suggesting authority such as a lab coat, the obediance was far creating as when they were in plain civilian clothes. This indeed suggests a relationship between legitimacy of authority and obedience.
A practical application of this theory is that it can help with social engineering in advertisements, as having legitimate authority figures like expert scientists telling you to buy a product, encourages the viewer to buy it more than if they were not an expert. This greater understanding of the theory therefore can have positive economic benefits.
This theory does have ethical implications, as it could suggest that people should not be held responsible for their actions in the court of law if they ordered to do so by an reputable authority figure. This provides large legal implications, initially in the persecution of the Nazi's in the immediate aftermath of the second world war which was the inital reason why Milgrams research took place.
