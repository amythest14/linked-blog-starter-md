Behaviourist explanation and treatment of phobias. Behaviourists believe that phobias form through association with another bad thing, in a process known as classical conditioning. An unconditioned stimulus (perhaps a dangerous scenario - something that has an innate response (fear)) is paired with a neutral stimulus (the thing that the phobia will be based on). The neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus as it gets associated with with the fear. This will lead to the formation of a phobia. This explanation might be incomplete however, as it doesn't explain why some people who have gone through the same situation won't get phobias whilst others will, suggesting that individual differences play an important part in the formation of phobia. Humans don't often display phobias towards the things that cause the most harm towards people in life in the modern world like cars or knives. They are far more likely to have phobias of snakes or spiders, which suggests that there are evolutionary factors at play that cause these instictive fear against threats found in nature.

OCD is characterised by obsessions and compulsions. The obsessions often take the form of instrusive thoughts, that can only be stopped the performance of a compulsion which is a behavioural ritual. Compulsions can be internal (counting etc), or external (cleaning, checking). Performing compulsions don't cause pleasure but rather the temporary relief from the intrusive thoughts.

Twin studies have shown concordance rates of OCD are higher in people who share more genetic material. One of the main genes found to be correlated with OCD is the SERT gene, which affects serotonin reuptake. This suggests that levels of serotonin may be responsible for causing OCD symptoms. In people with OCD, serotonin is reuptaken too quickly before it has the chance to bond to receptors in the post synaptic neurone. The resulting low levels of serotonin is thought to be what causes the obsessive thoughts associated with OCD. A large neural structure known as the 'worry circuit' also plays a role in OCD. Normally the basal ganglia system filters out worries so that minor worries coming from the OFC. In people with OCD, these are not filtered out as well, so minor worries go through to the thalamus and then this forms a loop as these worries are passed back to the OFC. This forms a loop that causes the recurring obsessive thoughts. This worry circuit can be interrupted by performing compulsions, but they soon resume. Basal ganglia are responsible for forming habits, leading to the ritualistic behaviour present in OCD.

Despite twin studies providing evidence for a genetic explanation, concordance is still less than 70% suggesting that there are other factors that affect OCD. A diathesis may therefore provide a better explanation
