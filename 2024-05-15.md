Social influence allows for social change as the principles of minority influence often apply. Social change starts with a minority fighting for some change, using commitment, flexibility, and consistensy to influence the views of others. This leads to a snowball effect as the number of people with the new belief grows there are more people to convince others and it eventually leads to a whole society adopting this new views. The society then experiences a form of societal amnesia where the belief becomes so normal that people forget the fight that happened in order for that change to happen. An example would be the womens rights movement, where the minority of women (in terms of power, not number) showed consistency and commitment to their beliefs that they should have the right to vote by partaking in peaceful and even violent protests consistently.

There are two main explanations for why people conform. The first is normative social influence, where people conform to the actions of a group because they do not want to stand out. Their private thoughts likely go unaffected, but publically they display the behaviours of the group. Jeff is displaying normative social influence by not attending the teacher strike as he is only doing it to not be the odd one out, rather than a genuine belief in the cause.
There is research which supports the idea of normative social influence as an explanation for conformity. Asch performed a study where a group was presented with two lines and they each had to say out loud which they thought was bigger. All but one of the group were confederates, who after a few normal rounds would all pick the obviously wrong line. The real participant would then also pick the wrong line in almost all cases, despite revealing afterwards in interviews that they did privately think the line was shorter. This displays evidence for the idea that people conform because they want to fit in with the group, despite differing private thoughts. 
This has resulted in practical applications where people are manipulated into performing a social action based on the idea that if they didn't they would be going against the societal norm. For example, hotels often display signs saying "9/10 people reuse their towels". By presenting it in this way, normative social influence means that people reading the sign will also reuse their towels as they want to fit in with the group, even if there is no physical group present. The success of signs like these have given additional legitimacy to normative social influence as an explanation for conformity.
The other explanation for conformity is informational, where people genuinely do not know the right way to behave, so they conform to the behaviour of the group to learn the right way of doing things. After this their private views will match their public views as they now know the "right way" to act. Steph shows informational social influence as they originally did not think they would ever strike, then after listening to the why strikes are important they then find themselves conforming to the group idea that strikes are good as the group has provided them with information to support that belief. Steph's internal beliefs now strongly agree with the strikes as they are now passionate about them. 
A limitation of these explanations is that there is often overlap between informational and normative social influence. In variations in Asch's study investigating the effect of task difficulty, they found that participants were more likely to conform when the task was more difficult. This suggested that rather than being strictly normative the participants couldve genuinely believed they were mistaken and the conformity then became partly informational. These kinds of overlaps suggest in reality there is an interactionist explanation that treats conformity as being affected by both normative and informational factors simultaneously.

Case studies as a research methods can be very important as they can allow insight into unusual people who do not normally get to be examined. In this example it would have been unethical to give someone amnesia so research into the effects of such a condition is limited and investigating the rare examples of this happening can provide newfound understanding into the working of the brain. However, since the case is generally so rare, this means that findings cannot be replicated and the inherently small sample size raises questions as to the validity of the research. Patients in case studies have rarely been assesed prior to whatever happened to make them worth investigating. This means there is a lack of a real control, and therefore the findings will have confounding variables, further reducing their validity.

Patient X supports the multi-store memory model as his short term memory remains unaffected despite the inability to create long-term memories. This suggests that memory is not a unitary store and short-term and long-term memory are stored differently in the brain - which supports the multi-store model.

Procedural memory is a type of long term memory about recalling how to perform tasks, such as Patient X tracking the disc. Another type of long term memory is episodic memories which are memories that provide data about an event in ones own life, such as Patient X having done the task - which he could not remember.

One difference is that procedural memory is not time-stamped whereas episodic memory is. Another difference is that procedural memories do not require conscious recollection, whereas episodic memories do.

Retrieval failure is an explanation for forgetting which says that memories are not able to be retrieved due to a lack of cues. Cues are needed in order to retrieve information from long term memory. This could involve a different a external condition when learning compared to recall such as being indoors versus being outdoors. This could also mean a change in internal state such as being drunk when learning something and being sober when attempting to retrieve it. In these scenarios, memories are forgotten as the lack of cues negatively impacts recall.

Many techniques are used within the cognitive interview to improve the accuracy of eye witness testimony. One technique is recalling events backwards, or from a different perspective. This disrupts the witnesses schema of the event which has been show to allow for more accurate recall. Another technique used is telling witnesses to say any details they can remember. This is because small details whilst unimportant can provide retrieval cues that allow for more things to be remembered, thus increasing the accuracy of recall. Witnesses may be asked to return to the scene of the crime either physically or mentally. This context reinstatement provides more retrieval cues which can allow for more accurate recall.

By testing inter-rater reliability, the researchers can see whether their categories are reliable. The researchers should both conduct their analysis of the essays independantly and then the results for 'references to love' should be correlated against each other. If the correlation coefficient is above 0.8 then the categories are considered relaible.

An interview can allow the researchers to ask open questions to the teenagers which will provide qualitative that provides additional insight that may not be gained from the quantitative data of the content analysis. Additionally since the content analysis has already been carried out they can ask participants to clarify on inconclusive parts of the content analysis, thus providing more information not gained from content analysis alone.

Bowby's monotropic theory explains attachment as a special bond between the child and the mother. The more consistent the parenting of the mother, the deeper this attachment will be. This attachment must be formed within the first 2 years of the childs life, the "sensitive period". It an attachment is not formed (or not maintained) in this time span then it will have irreversible damage on the child. They will often suffer from low IQ's and affectionless psychopathy. Bowlby also suggested that the quality of attachment had as a child will create an internal working model that will influence how the child views attachment throughout their whole life. In table 1, people who were in care made less references to love and more references to rejection than the non-care group. This suggests that their internal model has been affected by being in care, such that they think of attachment more negatively than those with a more regular upbrining.

Bowlbys theory makes clear that attachment is monotropic, meaning that it can only be formed to one caregiver. However, research by Schaffer into the stages of attachment shows that infants enter a stage where they do form multiple attachments. This contradicts the theory provided by Bowlby, thus casting doubt on the validity of the theory as a whole. The primary caregiver according to Bowlby is always the mother, however research has also shown that in situations where there isnt a mother to parent the child, the father will perform equally as well in raising the child and will form just as strong of an attachment. This contradicts another part of Bowlby's theory and suggests that it may suffer from a lack of temporal validity, as views on the father as a parent have evolved significantly as mothers work more and fathers spend more time with the child.

One biological explanation for OCD is a genetic explanation. This suggests that there are genes that are responsible for causing OCD, and that it is therefore inheritable. Multiple genes have been implicated as being related to OCD, namely the SERT gene and COMT gene, which influence the levels of serotonin and dopamine transmitted in the brain (which are both neurotransmitters that have been implicated in the development of OCD). There has been research to support this explanation with twin studies, which have shown increased levels of concordancy with OCD in MZ twins compared to other family members. However these levels are still not 100%, suggesting that there may be other cognitive factors like trauma that are responsible for OCD - implying a diethesis stress model might be the most accurate way of explaning OCD. Variations in these genes have only been correlated with OCD, rather than been shown to directly cause it which could mean that the relationship between genes and OCD is not necessarily causal and there may be more complex factors involved.

face validity is how valid a study seems at face value

concurrent validity is assessed by correlating the new scale or some such thing against an existing scale known to be valid. A strong correlation indicates that there is high concurrent validilty


a direct measurement of face vaility is obtained by asking people to rate the validity
