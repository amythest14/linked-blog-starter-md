## ONLXNE!

nice try
i saw it in ur status
ur online
is it honest if you fake it
bitch reply
is it a promise if you break it



kicking my feet
still in my bed
your all i need
eye roll
but
your in my head

and we like
all the same songs
and i find
not talking so wrong
bad time
thought i was your best friend
just that?
then why you talking like this then
oh my
i wanna know you better than your best friend
i wanna be your best friend
i wanna know you better than your girlfriend
i wanna be your girlfriend
back of my hand
front of my mind
it's hard to breathe
when you’re not mine
it's hard to sleep
when you're online

i've been a
good girl
if that's what you wanna call it
its a 
big world
and i've honest
i'm busy being online
i got it if you want it 
need you online



you dreamt of me again?





i wanna know you better than your best friend
i wanna be your best friend
i wanna know you better than your girlfriend
i wanna be your girlfriend
back of my hand
front of my mind
it's hard to breathe
when you’re not mine
it's hard to sleep
when you're online


 
## OUT MY HEAD

  
 i wish that i was the most beautiful girl you'd ever seen
but i think that that's unlikely
always too hot or too cold
never something in between

so look me in the eye
and tell me what i mean
i mean, to you

you are not here
a spectral projection
taunting me with what i can't have
are you my angel
offering me protection
or a succubus
here for my inevitable erection

i need you here
and i need you now
i'll feel the fear
and i'll need you out

can't get you out my head
can't get you out my head
it's like you need me dead
need you to cut me open
and eat me out
i need you here
i need you now

and i like when i am in your mouth
so  speak my name
and speak it loud
## TENDONS

i want you still
i dont know how to feel
dont know how to say
i want you still
i know this isnt real

worst ive ever been
for the tenth day in a row
i am never seen
guess youll never know

i want you still
i dont know how to feel
i dont know how to live
without your attention

that i crave
id do it all just for the mention
grab that knife we could go to heaven
 lips on lips id call that ascension
blood on blood your fucking up my tendons
cut me off but that wasnt your intention
cut me up i’m acting with a vengeance 

i put words in your mouth 
as soon as i’m in then you’re out
not much to say
fuck you anyway
or we can just hang out

  

  

  

  

## QUIETLY UPSET

  
when i blow out all the candles
i wish to be with you
and the one thing i can’t handle
is knowing it won’t come true

remember when we were something
when we spoke every night
i bet you think it meant nothing
i bet you wish you were right

i got quietly upset when i went away for two days and you didn’t say you missed me
i get quietly upset for every time where if we were together it felt like you’d kiss me
i get quietly upset when you reference private conversations with mutual friends because i’m scared you’re getting closer to them than me
i get quietly upset when you bring your new situationship up
i get quietly upset when you don’t bring them up because you know it’ll make me upset
i get quietly upset when you don’t laugh at my jokes
i made them for you
i get upset at how much i love you
because i do love you

## UNPROVOKED
if i said i dont like you
even though its a lie you
would still be right there

i dont want to fight you
its the middle of the night
and im
so tired

so what the fuck was i supposed to do
you expected me to just stop wanting you?
so what the fuck do you want to do
keep pretending that you don't feel it too
what do you expect me to do
i couldnt bring myself to just not acknowledge you

i'll take back everything i said
but not everything i did
i hope you'll
understand
so i'll keep provoking you
remind you of things that i wrote to you
till i know where you stand

you said that i looked pretty
or pretty bad i don't recall
convincing myself its the former
becomes increasingly more effortful
## FALLXNG

  
you’re falling
i call your name
you don’t respond
you’re falling 
i can’t catch you
you’re too far  gone
you’re falling
falling out of my life

i can’t sleep
you are on my mind
my eyes are red and open

i love you more than the day you broke my heart
i try to tell you but i don’t know where to start
and i might mean yesterday but even then the same was true
everyday you break me i break into you
every time you say my name i swear i fall apart
wanted to talk another day god damn that left a mark
another day of tears and it sure won’t be the last
why don’t i just disappear so you can leave me in the past


  
## TEXT FIRST

  
how long would it take for you to text first
every time we talks material for the next verse
sex first
hop into the lexus
its a car crash but we always tryna fix us
lie to me baby tell me we can make it work
i dance around the subject tell my legs hurt


your head is spinning trying to be patient
you like me more when i don’t take my medication
you’re telling me to stop avoiding the conversation
i’ve been trying to describe the sensation
of being in love with you
equal parts drowning and elation


you’ve made me sob till i’m shaking
you said you care i know you’re faking 

  
we’re a tritone apart i can’t help but feel diminished
fifth time this week you’ve told me that we’re finished
talking on our friends like they mean something to you
can't trust my brains or my body because of you
guess that i'm not special guess that i'm just bitches
bitches that won't leave cause you still send me your pictures

## HEAT OF THE MOMENT


in the pouring rain
you ask “what did you say?”
and i don’t want to repeat
without the spontaneity
now my words stand alone
and you can see me for what i truly am

heat of the moment 
heat of my love

sometimes it feels like you can’t look at me
in the eye
make me die
one last time
oh what it could’ve been

i wish that we were closer
i need you in my life
i’ll text you when i’m sober
apologise for last night
  
## WHY’D YOU SAY IT TO ME / MUTUAL

  
old feelings 
you need me
i need you

our love is fucked but it’s mutual
wanted to fuck  —------- seduced you
is this what i’m reduced to

you don’t say i love you to friends
then why’d you say it to me
you’ll avoid me to the end
i swear you’d make enemies
if you weren’t so

pluh pluh 

  

i’m dying underneath
and you won’t text me back
i’m lying through my teeth
might have a heart attack
  

## LXSTEN.

fingers on fingers on fingers on lips
lingers on lingers on 
light shining through crack
like a solar eclipse
point of view point of view

my songs that i sent to you
but you didnt listen
careless mistake
or conscious decision
i smashed my phone
so now you just glisten
they were 
but do you still miss them?

fingers on fingers on strings
the vibrations don’t make it
past cracks in the screen
you’re my monday whisper
it lingers it lingers
you’re making my lips hurt
i miss them it lingers
i need them i miss them
are we only friends now
you say that you miss them
it’s over i miss how
we were i hope we are
not friends never friends
you've got a girlfriend
never end never end
ever dead ever dead
need the evidence
evidence
effervesce forever-ness

### MID?

i texted you in tears 

and you didn’t erply

and then i’ve never wanted more to die

i was so grateful i was already crying 

so that you didn’t make me





put your hands on my fragile body

and hold me so tight i shatter

i’m broken but you’ve still got me

i don’t know why you think that even matters







do you think about me when i’m not there like i do?

cause i spend all day thinking of words that try to

show what i think 

about you

i know i’m easy to lie to








you and me

fast asleep

on the floor

hard to beat

you make me

feel i can’t get any more

happy

  

feeling weak

every week

never loving life

cross the street

you and me 

putting up a fight




you said that i looked pretty

or pretty bad i don’t recall

convincing myself its the former

because increasingly more effortful



### SCRAPS


  

exes for eyes

  
  
  
  
cause if you didnt care then 

who would

i thought if anyone could fix me

you could 

so if you want to leave

you should

  
  
  

i’m so tired

of wishing i was with you

i’m so tired of pretending i don’t miss you

  

the smoke from your lungs

still burns my tongue

  

  

you’re my monday whisper

you make my lips hurt

  
  
  



test test that this could in fact be backing up
